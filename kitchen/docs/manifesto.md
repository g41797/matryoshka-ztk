## Two Different Worlds

Most software systems have two very different parts.

---

### The I/O part

This part deals with the outside world.

- Sockets.
- Files.
- Timers.
- Event loops.
- Synchronization.
- Operating system APIs.

The I/O part

- requires low-level programming
- requires understanding how the platform works
- has its own specialists and its own way of thinking

---


### The Process part

This is where the application does its real work.

For example:

- Image processing.
- Video transcoding.
- Financial calculations.
- Business workflows.
- Data analysis.

Most developers specialize in this layer.

They

- understand their domain 
- want to solve domain problems
- usually do not want to spend time learning unrelated
    - APIs
    - frameworks
    - infrastructure

I/O developers and Process developers often speak *different languages*.

## What Matryoshka-Ztk Is For

Matryoshka-Ztk

- is designed for the Process part 
- does **not** replace an I/O library
- does **not** solve
    - networking
    - polling
    - file handling
    - operating system integration

Instead, it provides

- tools for the code that runs
    - **after** data enters the system
    - **before** data leaves the system

Its goal is

- to let developers think in terms of
    - processing
    - messages
    - pools
    - workflows
- instead of low-level details

The funny part is that Matryoshka-Ztk was created by an I/O developer.

Me.

---


## Remember

---


- I/O _moves_ data.
- Matryoshka-Ztk organizes processing of data.

---

## Four tools. One principle. Common language.

---


Every Matryoshka-Ztk system is built from _four building blocks_:

- **Master** — execution
- **Item** — state/data/command/...
- **Mailbox** — communication
- **Pool** — resource reuse

They all follow one _principle_:

> **Share by communicating.**

You stop talking about:

- tasks
- futures
- mutexes
- queues

You start talking on Matryoshka-Ztk language:

- Masters
- Items
- Mailboxes
- Pools

---

### Master

A **Master** is

- an _Threaded_ Io _task_
- created by _concurrent()_
- follows the Matryoshka-Ztk rules
- holds its own state
- works with Items
- communicate with another Masters and/or application


---


### Item

An **Item** is

- movable application object
    - PDLChunk
    - Session
    - RawBuffer
    - JobTicket
    -  ...
- **allocated** (as all tools)
- outlive the function that created them

The one rule that matters:

> An Item is in exactly one place at any moment.

**ONE PLACE**:

- or Master uses it
- or a Mailbox holds it
- or a Pool holds it

> **Never several at once**.

---

### Item and ItemHandle.

The documentation talks about _Item(s)_.      
The API works with an **ItemHandle**.

You are thinking in terms of:

- read _file_
- write _file_
- close _file_

on API level one of the arguments is _file handle_.

The same is for Matryoshka-Ztk API

- you are thinking in terms of _Item_ - Application entity
- API is working with _ItemHandle_ - Matryoshka-Ztk entity


---


### Mailbox

A **Mailbox** moves an Item from one Master to another:

- One Master places an Item in
    - Mailbox becomes the only holder of the Item
- Another Master later receives it
    - The receiver becomes the only holder of the Item

---


### Pool

A **Pool**

- create new Items
- holds reusable Items

Usually Master

- gets Item from Pool
- process Item
- on finish
    - send Item to another Master for further processing
    - returns Item to Pool

A Pool is not storage.  
An empty Pool is

- not an error
- it is information e.g. _backpressure_.

---

## Master is King

---

Master is YOUR CODE.

Only Master

- makes decisions
- owns application state
- uses tools
  - Mailbox - for communication
  - Pool - for storage/reuse

---

Be Master **of your** systems.

---



##  Take it easy

---


Start with Items.

Add a Pool when reuse becomes useful.

Organize long-running tasks as Masters.

You will need to add a Mailbox(es) for communication. 

---

Can you describe your application using only

- Masters
- Items
- Mailboxes
- Pools

If

- **yes** - you are on the right way
- no - [you still have the chance](https://github.com/g41797/matryoshka-ztk){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
