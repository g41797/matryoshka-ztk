# Tools — Pool

---

Everything reusable lives here.

A Pool gives out items for reuse, instead of allocating fresh ones in a hot loop.

## What a Pool does

A Pool gives out items for reuse instead of a fresh allocation every time.

```text
new(hooks) — into a Slot, then take the pointer out
  ↓
empty pool

get() [pool empty]                get() [pool has items]
  ↓ a fresh item is created          ↓ an item is reused
with caller                        with caller

put() [kept]                       put() [destroyed]
  ↓                                  ↓
back in the pool                   caller frees it

close()
  ↓ every stored item is given back for the caller to free
```

- `get` gives a handle to the caller — reused if one is free, freshly made otherwise.
- `put` returns the handle — the Pool decides whether to keep it or let it go.
- `close` collects everything still held and passes it to your `on_close`
  hook, which releases it.

## A Pool resource is an empty container

A Pool is not storage.

- Getting an item back tells you nothing about what it holds — that's up to your hooks.
- `put` can keep the item as-is.
- `put` can keep it after resetting its data.
- `put` can delete it.
- `put` can delete it and hand back a different item instead.
- Nothing you `put` in is guaranteed to still be there on the next `get`.
- No fixed count/order/identity survives a put/get sequence unless your hooks guarantee it.
- See [API Reference — Pool](../api/pool/put.md) for the four `put` outcomes.

- A Pool resource alone never defines a complete pattern.
- Useful work always needs at least one other input too: a Mailbox message, a
  network read, a timer tick, some shared state.

## The Pool touches items — through your hooks

This is the difference from a [Mailbox](mailbox.md), which never touches an  
Item at all. A Pool creates, resets, keeps or destroys — but every one of  
those is your hook doing it, never the Pool deciding on its own.

## A closed Pool gives items back

A Pool does not care whether you closed it either. Only `destroy` insists,  
and panics on an open Pool.

- `put` on a closed Pool is a no-op and leaves the Slot unchanged.
- `put_all` stops at the first refusal and leaves the rest in your list.

Either way you still hold those Items and must release them. So check the  
Slot after `put`, and check the list after `put_all`.

Closing releases through `on_close`, not through you — the other difference  
from a Mailbox, which returns the list to the caller and leaves the  
releasing to them.

## An empty Pool is a signal, not an error

- When nothing is free, the caller waits — that's backpressure, not a failure.
- No separate rate limiter, no manual throttling code.
- One event loop watches "a Mailbox message arrived" and "a Pool item became free"
  side by side. A worker returns an item — whoever was waiting resumes.

A worker pool, end to end, in [Matryoshka-Ztk notation](../addendums/matryoshka-ztk-notation.md):

```
[ Worker ]  >>> get() >>>  { Job Processor }

                                  | uses the Worker

[ Worker ]  <<< put() <<<  { Job Processor }
```

If `[ Worker ]` is empty when `get()` is called, `{ Job Processor }` waits.

That wait ends the moment some other `{ Job Processor }` calls `put()`.
