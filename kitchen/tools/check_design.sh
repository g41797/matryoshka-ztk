# Gate for the design/ folder. Four checks, all of which DOC 22 ran by hand:
#
#   1. Dead cross-references, in both syntaxes. DOC 22's manual sweep only
#      validated [text](target.md); refs written as `target.md` were invisible
#      to it and 23 of them were dead.
#   2. Orphans. Every file under design/ is named in exactly one context.md.
#   3. Forward-looking prose. design/ describes what is, not what will be.
#   4. Glossary conformance. Retired vocabulary must not reappear.
#
# Exit 0 when clean, 1 on any hit. Read-only — reports, never edits.
#
# design/secondary/ is exempt from checks 1, 3 and 4: it is frozen by the
# "Where a doc lives" rule in rules-049.md and its links are not repaired.
# STATUS-LOG.md is exempt from the same three: it is an append-only historical
# narrative and legitimately names docs that no longer exist.

# ownership — retired in favour of hold/transfer. "owner" meaning the human
#            who runs the project is allowed, so only the noun is checked.
#
# Four exemptions, all cases where the retired word is the subject rather than
# the voice of the sentence:
#   - "Status file ownership" — the name of a rule in rules-049.md.
#   - change-log and ledger rows — "| 020 | ... dropped ownership framing ..."
#     and "- DOC 18 — ... DONE" record that a pass happened. Rewriting them
#     would falsify history.
#   - "Change from" notes at the head of a versioned doc, same reason.
#   - `022-ownership_transfer.zig` — an example filename, owner's decision.
# rules-049.md and language-of-matryoshka.md carry the banned-word table
# itself and are exempt from the ownership check.
# Beyond those, kitchen/tools/.check_design_allow holds literal substrings for the
# handful of change-log rows that record a banned-word pass. See its header.
