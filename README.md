Software has two worlds.

- The first moves data.
- The second processes data.

Matryoshka-Tk is a _toolkit_ for the second world.

## What Matryoshka-Tk Is For

---

Matryoshka-Tk provides

- tools for the code that runs
  - **after** data enters the system
  - **before** data leaves the system
  - **within** long-running _tasks_

Typical example of such system - Image processing pipeline.

Goal of Matryoshka:

- to let developers think in terms of
  - processing
  - inter-tasks communication
  - reusing
  - workflows
- instead of low-level details
