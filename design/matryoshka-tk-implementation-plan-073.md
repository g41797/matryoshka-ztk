# Matryoshka Zig — Implementation Plan (073)

Change from -072: the RENAME stage is added and named by the owner, 2026-09-14.  
The repo and its root folder become `matryoshka-ztk`. Code names stay  
`matryoshka`. The stage runs in a fresh clone, so this file carries how to  
start it. Nothing else changed.

Change from -071: INTR 8 is closed. Open Item 14 ruled and closed, and  
rules-049.md carries both halves of the superseded-version rule. All three sub-stages landed on 2026-08-14  
and collapse to one line each in Completed stages. The finished API 13  
sub-stages collapse with them. What is left forward-looking: FLOW 1-2 and 1-3, 13-4b-3, 13-5, the  
deferred pool, and the audit that ranks the parked work.

Change from -070: INTR 8 inserted and designed. `mailbox.new` and `pool.new`  
move onto the Slot idiom, a checked `destroy_slot` joins them, and the  
infrastructure-item and application-item classes are named. Everything the API 13  
close-out left open is parked, unfinished, and re-ranked after INTR 8 — owner's  
ruling, 2026-08-14.

**Reconstructed 2026-08-12.** Versions -056 through -059 were lost: the agent  
deleted -059 while the command meant to create -060 had already failed, and  
-058 had never been committed. Rebuilt from -055 in HEAD, which carries the  
stage list through WEB 1 verbatim, plus `STATUS-LOG.md` for everything after it.  
Summary lines for the stages between WEB 1 and API 12-1 are written from the  
log, not the originals. Everything from API 12-1 on is exact.

## Status

Current state lives in [STATUS.md](STATUS.md), not here. This file carries  
forward-looking work and one line per completed stage.

Version note: `-070`, `-071` and `-072` are kept on disk as the historical record. All  
are listed in the Superseded versions section of [context.md](context.md), so  
the orphan gate passes without deleting either. That section is the standing  
resolution of Open Item 14 — it breaks no rule and needs no deletion. `-069` was  
deleted against Part 0 and is unrecoverable — see STATUS-LOG.md, 2026-08-13.

Last completed stage: INTR 8-3, 2026-08-14.

**The tree builds.** All four modes 195/195, three cross targets green,  
`zig build stories` green. The `tests/zig_mechanisms.zig` breakage that blocked  
INTR 8-1 was fixed on 2026-08-14 with the owner's approval; see STATUS-LOG.md.

INTR 8 is closed. All three sub-stages are done, 2026-08-14.

**RENAME is the named next stage.** Owner's call, 2026-09-14. It runs in the  
fresh clone `matryoshka-ztk`, after the owner saves, pushes and renames. The  
audit that ranks the parked work stays parked until RENAME is done.

---

## How to start the RENAME stage

The owner does steps 1-3. The agent starts at step 4.

1. Save and push `matryoshka-tk`, including this plan.
2. Rename the repo on GitHub to `matryoshka-ztk`.
3. Clone it locally as `/home/g41797/dev/root/github.com/g41797/matryoshka-ztk`.
4. Start a new session in that folder. Not `/clear` — `/clear` keeps the old
   working directory.
   - `cd /home/g41797/dev/root/github.com/g41797/matryoshka-ztk`
   - `claude`
   - `/model` → **Opus 5**. The stage is path and script judgment, not typing.
5. Paste this prompt:

```
Repo was renamed matryoshka-tk -> matryoshka-ztk; this is the fresh clone.
Read design/STATUS.md in full, then Part 0 of design/rules-049.md,
then stage RENAME in design/matryoshka-tk-implementation-plan-073.md.
Code names (matryoshka) do not change. Docs generation first.
Show intent and wait for my approval before any edit. Confirm, wait.
```

6. The agent's first checks:
   - `pwd` ends in `matryoshka-ztk`.
   - `git status` is clean.
   - Agent memory from the old folder does not load. Everything needed is in
     STATUS.md and this file. That is by design.

---

## RENAME — matryoshka-tk becomes matryoshka-ztk

The repo and the root folder are renamed. Sibling ports: otk (Odin), 3tk (C3).  
The Odin repo went through the same rename first. Its trouble spot was the docs  
generation scripts.

What does not change:
- The Zig module name. `build.zig.zon` `.name = .matryoshka`.
- `@import("matryoshka")`, `matryoshka.*`, every identifier.
- Frozen material: `design/secondary/`, `kitchen/defer/`, past entries in
  `STATUS-LOG.md`, superseded doc versions.

### Owner rulings — ask first, before any edit

Ask as numbered plain text.

- **R1 — brand text.** `Matryoshka-Tk` appears in `kitchen/docs/manifesto.md`
  (9 times), `kitchen/docs/addendums/installation.md`, `kitchen/docs/tools/pool.md` and `kitchen/mkdocs.yml`.  
  New spelling, or keep it?
- **R2 — file renames.** The owner does the moves. Candidates:
  - `design/matryoshka-tk-implementation-plan-*.md` — the next version name.
  - `design/matryoshka-Tk-diagram-style-guide-003.md`
  - `kitchen/docs/addendums/matryoshka-tk-notation.md`
  - `kitchen/_logo/matryoshka-tk-logo.png` and its copy under `kitchen/docs/assets/`
- **R3 — `src/` doc comments.** The nine `//!` URL lines are in the owner-edit
  zone. Permission to change the URL lines only.
- **R4 — design notes with history.** `api-13-book-002.md` and the changelog
  rows of `matryoshka-zig-0.16-notes-003.md`. Change live URLs only, keep  
  history rows as written?
- **Ask also:** what exactly broke in the Odin repo's docs scripts. Check the
  same spots here.

### A — docs generation, first

- `kitchen/mkdocs.yml`
  - lines 5-6: `repo_url: https://github.com/g41797/Matryoshka-Tk/` and `repo_name`.
  - line 187: the notation page path, if R2 renames it.
  - no `site_url` today. Decide whether to add
    `https://g41797.github.io/matryoshka-ztk/`.
- Scripts. Read-only grep on 2026-09-14 found no absolute path and no repo name.
  Each resolves paths from its own location.
  - `kitchen/tools/build_site.sh`, `preview_site.sh`, `preview_apidocs.sh`
  - `kitchen/tools/docs_zig.sh`, `gen_examples_docs.sh`, `gen_diagrams.sh`
  - `kitchen/tools/count_src_loc.sh`, `relink_md.py`, `kitchen/hooks/count_lines.py`
  - Verify by running them in the clone, not by reading.
- `.github/workflows/docs.yml` names no repo. GitHub Pages on the renamed repo is
  the owner's check.
- Generated output in root `docs/`: rebuild, then grep it for `matryoshka-tk`.

### B — site-facing text

- `README.md`
  - line 1: logo path.
  - lines 10-13: four CI badge URLs.
  - line 77: docs site URL.
- `kitchen/docs/index.md` line 23: logo asset.
- `kitchen/docs/addendums/installation.md`: name text, and
  `zig fetch --save git+https://github.com/g41797/matryoshka-ztk`.
- `kitchen/docs/manifesto.md`: brand (R1), GitHub link on line 278.
- `kitchen/docs/tools/pool.md` line 80: notation link (R1, R2).

### C — `src/`, comments only (R3)

- `src/matryoshka.zig` lines 12, 15, 18.
- `src/polynode.zig` lines 22, 25.
- `src/mailbox.zig` lines 25, 28.
- `src/pool.zig` lines 24, 27.
- `https://g41797.github.io/matryoshka-tk/...` → `.../matryoshka-ztk/...`.

### D — `design/`, versioning rules apply

- `matryoshka-api-reference-042.md`: 11 site URLs. New `-043`, link cascade,
  `-042` into Superseded versions.
- `api-13-book-002.md` lines 216, 452: URLs (R4).
- `matryoshka-zig-0.16-notes-003.md` line 10: name in prose.
- `STATUS.md`: title, folder tree. In place.
- Only if R2 renames the plan file:
  - `rules-049.md` line 103, the plan file name. New rules version.
  - `kitchen/tools/check_design.sh` line 116, the plan glob.

### Gates

- `kitchen/build_and_test_debug.sh` → `build_and_test_all.sh` →
  `build_cross_debug.sh`. Output to `zig-out/` logs.
- `kitchen/tools/build_site.sh`, with the nav check.
- `kitchen/tools/preview_site.sh`, the rendered-page check. `src/` comments changed.
- `kitchen/tools/check_design.sh` exit 0.
- Final grep for `matryoshka-tk` outside frozen areas. Only history rows remain.
- Banned-word scan, README sync, rules audit.
- STATUS-LOG.md entry with a Post-stage cleanup row. New plan version.
- At the end: name the model for the next stage, and say clear or compact.

- EXMPL 5a-5e — receive router: design note, example + test, pattern docs, catalog and nav, `cancelDiscard` audit over 15 sites with no defects. DONE 2026-07-27 (169/169). Design: [receive-router-002.md](receive-router-002.md).
- API 6 — `identifyNodeAs`/`identifySlotAs` → `fromNode`/`fromSlot` (+ `must`), new `moveFromSlot`, ~222 call sites. DONE 2026-07-28 (170/170).
- API 7a-7d — `toNode`, the outbound accessor; three `src/` hand-rolls self-hosted; `src/polynode.zig` doc comments fixed. DONE 2026-07-29 (171/171).
- API 7e — closed as superseded: `ItemList.append` takes an `ItemHandle`, so the sites `toListNode` targeted are gone. See [item-list-011.md](item-list-011.md) Q22.
- API 8a-8d — `ItemList` closes the `std.DoublyLinkedList` boundary; five public signatures moved; `popFirst` turns the reset trap into a type guarantee. DONE 2026-07-29 (175/175). Design: [item-list-011.md](item-list-011.md).
- API 9 — intrusive safety: `appendFromSlot`/`prependFromSlot`, `tests/layer1_itemlist.zig`, the `_holds` walk, `concat` self-check. Misuse cases 1 and 5 stay open by decision (Q26 = D). DONE 2026-07-30 (177/177).
- API 10 — `ItemList` completion: `remove`, `popLast`, `first`, `last`, `insertBefore`; `iterate` → `iterator`; `concat` self-concat leak fixed. DONE 2026-07-31 (182/182).
- API 11 — `fromNode`/`mustFromNode`/`toNode` → `fromPoly`/`mustFromPoly`/`toPoly`, 164 call sites. Slot accessors keep their names. DONE 2026-07-31 (182/182).
- DISPATCH 1 — tag-first dispatch documented; `switch (tag)` proven not to compile, recorded in [llvm-pointer-switch-bug-001.md](secondary/llvm-pointer-switch-bug-001.md) with a repro and a build matrix. DONE 2026-07-31 (185/185).
- DISPATCH 2 — table dispatch documented; the handler belongs to the pair (receiver, tag), so the choice moves into data. `examples/helpers/TagTable.zig`, scenarios 113-117. No `src/` change. DONE 2026-07-31 (192/192). Working doc: [table-dispatch-002.md](table-dispatch-002.md).
- CMPCT 1 — STATUS/plan/log/context de-duplicated; rules-038 "Status file ownership". DONE 2026-08-01 (192/192, doc-only).
- CMPCT 2 — rules regrouped into rules-039.md: gates first, one topic in one place, dated rationale moved to the log, six stale links fixed. No rule changed meaning. DONE 2026-08-01 (192/192, doc-only).
- DOC 22 — `design/` compacted to the current picture. Five concept docs merged into [matryoshka-concepts-003.md](matryoshka-concepts-003.md); nine files moved to `design/secondary/` (frozen, indexed by its own `context.md`); eight deleted; `context.md` rewritten; every dead cross-reference repaired. New in [rules-049.md](rules-049.md): where a doc lives, present tense in `design/`, story file layout. DONE 2026-08-02 (192/192, doc-only).
- DOC 23 — the two large docs split by audience. `matryoshka-tk-0.16-implementation-guide-001.md` retired: its Odin idiom mapping to [secondary/odin-to-zig-backport-001.md](secondary/odin-to-zig-backport-001.md), its still-binding material to [matryoshka-zig-0.16-notes-003.md](matryoshka-zig-0.16-notes-003.md), its walkthroughs of shipped code deleted with owner approval. [matryoshka-architecture-foundation-4-006.md](matryoshka-architecture-foundation-4-006.md) drops the four sections `matryoshka-concepts-003.md` already owns and renames `MayItem` to `Slot`. New gate `kitchen/tools/check_design.sh`. DONE 2026-08-02 (192/192, doc-only).
- WEB 1 — the landing page reaches the API docs. `kitchen/docs/index.md`: the `XYZ Lines Of Code` badge is now the link to `apidocs/`, opening in a new tab; the API button above it, hidden by CSS since it was added, is deleted. `kitchen/docs/stylesheets/extra.css`: the badge gains link styling and a per-scheme hover, and the button styling it made dead — `.hero-button`, both `-primary` and `-secondary` scheme pairs, the `display: none` rule, the unused `.hero-buttons` selector — is removed. DONE 2026-08-02 (doc-only, no `src/` change).

- Errors as type IDs — owner's proposal tested and rejected. `@intFromError`
  is a real comptime `u16` and does work in a `switch`, so the DISPATCH 1 wall  
  is about pointers, not tags. Errors are interned by name globally with no  
  unique-name source, so the scheme cannot be made safe. Written down as
  [secondary/error-as-type-id-001.md](secondary/error-as-type-id-001.md).
  DONE 2026-08-02 (no `src/` change).
- API 12 chosen and designed — real pointers for Mbox/Pool. `_Mailbox`/`_Pool`
  become public `Mbox`/`Pool`, flattened onto `matryoshka.*`, hard break with  
  no alias, both keeping an embedded `PolyNode` so they still travel as  
  payload. Design: [api-12-real-pointers-005.md](api-12-real-pointers-005.md).  
  DONE 2026-08-12 (design only).
- API 12-1 — `src/` rewrite to real pointers. `Mbox`/`Pool` public, handles and
  PolyHelper aliases gone, methods on the pointer, companion types nested,  
  `Io.ConcurrentError` in place of two local copies. New `zig build core` step
  + `kitchen/build_core_debug.sh`. DONE 2026-08-12 (core green; 72 old call
  sites left for 12-2/12-3).
- API 12-2 — `tests/` moved to the pointer API. Five files, about 550 call
  sites. Scenarios 93 and 94 in `layer4_infra.zig` were the only  
  non-mechanical part: a pointer is no longer a `Slot`, so they cross the  
  border explicitly. Stories moved onto their own `zig build stories` step.  
  Scenario lists resynced as [task1-tests-008.md](task1-tests-008.md) and
  [task2-tests-004.md](task2-tests-004.md). DONE 2026-08-12 (120/120 with the
  example wrappers held out).
- API 12-3 — `examples/` and the story moved to the pointer API. 63 files:
  11 in layer2, 4 in layer3, 48 in layer4, plus `video_transcoder.zig`. The  
  two transport examples, `095-mailbox_as_item.zig` and  
  `096-pool_as_item.zig`, were the only non-mechanical work. Doc comments  
  swept including ASCII diagrams. DONE 2026-08-12 (191/191, release matrix and  
  cross builds green).
- API 12-4 — docs audit, the last sub-stage. `kitchen/docs/examples/**`
  regenerated from the migrated sources (88 pages). 34 hand-written site pages  
  swept, plus 11 design docs versioned up: api-reference -034, patterns -026,  
  item-list -010, zig-notes -003, receive-router -002, concepts -002,  
  table-dispatch -002, task1-tests -007, task2-examples -007,  
  print-server -003, video-transcoder -004. The two deferred write-ups,  
  Worker-finish-signal and Wrapper, rewritten around `Mbox.mustFromPoly`  
  rather than renamed. No code change. DONE 2026-08-12.
- TESTSYNC 1 — test names resynced with the scenario docs. 23 names in
  `tests/layer3_pool.zig` and `tests/layer4_cancel.zig` still read  
  `pool.get` / `mailbox.close`; they now match the pointer form the scenario  
  lists already used. Three had drifted in wording as well (74, 75, 77) and  
  were aligned to [task1-tests-008.md](task1-tests-008.md). Also fixed in the  
  same pass: 15 `std.log.info` strings in `examples/layer4/`, left over from  
  12-3's doc-comment sweep. DONE 2026-08-12 (191/191).

- MBOX 1 — the mailbox audit, the deferred twin of INTR 7. The framing the
  docs were missing: the mailbox keeps items, it never touches them — no  
  inspection, no copy, no free — so everything it keeps goes back to a caller,  
  and releasing  
  it is the caller's job. Written into `src/mailbox.zig`, the concept and api  
  pages, and the API reference, with the mirror statements for Pool (it does  
  touch items, through hooks; a closed pool gives them back; `close`  
  releases through `on_close`). Code: 32 `_ = mbx.close()` sites replaced by  
  an unconditional release, a refused `send` of a pool item in  
  `056-job_pool_circular.zig`, unchecked `put_all` leftovers in 034 and 040,  
  and four `mbh` names API 12 missed. Found and fixed on the way: 15  
  documented asserts that never existed in `src/`, and  
  `kitchen/docs/tools/pool.md` claiming `Pool.close` gives items back to the  
  caller when it passes them to `on_close`. Follow-up in the same session:  
  every item `tests/layer2_mailbox.zig` sends is now allocated, closing its  
  own violation of Part 8's "never send a stack-allocated item" — 33 sites,  
  no rule exemption needed. No `src/` behaviour change.  
  DONE 2026-08-12 (191/191). Rules: [rules-049.md](rules-049.md).

- AUDIT 1 — the give-back audit made repeatable. MBOX 1 and INTR 7 did the
  same kind of work a month apart and shared no method, so the method is now  
  written down instead of re-derived. `kitchen/tools/audit_edges.sh` +  
  `audit_edges.py`: classifies every give-back edge as  
  COVERED / CATCH-FREES / DISCARDED / BARE, and checks every documented  
  `Assert:` entry against the asserts in `src/`. Reports, never edits; exits 0  
  always, deliberately not a gate. [audit-recipe-002.md](audit-recipe-002.md)  
  carries what the script cannot: the edge table, the four verdicts and why  
  there is no fifth, the read-only-then-report ordering, and the post-MBOX-1  
  baseline to diff against. No change to `src/`, `tests/`, `examples/`,  
  `stories/` or `kitchen/docs/`. DONE 2026-08-12 (191/191, tooling + doc).

- **PROSE 1** — full banned-word and prose pass, plus the first check of Zig
  snippets inside docs. Scanned 294 live files against Part 5. The raw count  
  was ~500; the live count was ~20, the gap being `STATUS-LOG.md`,  
  `design/secondary/` and `kitchen/defer/`, none of which may be rewritten.  
  Fixed in place: the slot-based-programming addendum (11 hold-language  
  rewrites, two section titles), the manifesto, `kitchen/notes.md`, the  
  polynode manual-definition page, and `tests/layer1_polynode.zig`  
  (`dll_node` → `list_node`). Five design docs  
  bumped for real prose defects: api-reference, architecture, api-12,  
  diagram-style, rules. `kitchen/defer/` declared frozen, and Part 5 gained a  
  scan scope so the next run does not re-derive what is off-limits. 475 Zig  
  snippets in 129 doc pages checked: no `_ = mbx.close()` anywhere, seven  
  pre-API-12 lines confined to the now-frozen `kitchen/defer/`.  
  DONE 2026-08-12 (191/191).

- **FLOW 1-1 / 1-1r** — the canonical `Usual flow` text for a mailbox (four
  steps) and a pool (five, the extra one being `init`), in staccato.  
  DONE 2026-08-13 (191/191, doc-only).

- **INTR 8-2** — every caller moves to Slot-based creation. 186 `new` sites in
  70 files, 39 `pl.init(hooks)` lines deleted. Master fields stay non-optional  
  by the owner's ruling, against the design note; the unwrap is once, at  
  creation. `examples/layer4/018-master_with_pool.zig` was rewritten and  
  approved first, because Part 1 of the rules names it as the canonical Master  
  and 8-3 writes the acquisition shape into that rule. Six hook-less pools got  
  hooks, one of them changing a scenario's meaning. `destroy_slot` gained its  
  first callers. DONE 2026-08-14 (195/195, four modes, three cross targets,  
  stories green).

- **INTR 8-1** — `src/`. `mailbox.new` and `pool.new` fill a Slot and return
  `!void`; the pointer-returning `new` deleted, hard break, no alias.  
  `destroy_slot` added to both, a null Slot a no-op and a wrong type a panic.  
  `Pool.init` stopped being `pub` and became the private step `new` calls, so  
  `.hooks` is set in the struct literal and no field is ever `undefined`. Two  
  deviations from the design note, both narrower than it described.  
  `fromSlot`, `mustFromSlot` and `moveFromSlot` re-exported on both types.  
  DONE 2026-08-14 (core gate green; the suite knowingly broken until 8-2, the  
  same shape API 12-1 ran in).

- **INTR 8-3** — the documents. Six new versions: api-reference -042,
  patterns -029, task1-tests -008, task2-tests -004, rules -048 and the INTR 8  
  design note -003. Both tools now read the same four `Usual flow` steps; the  
  pool lost its `init` step, because the hooks are a parameter of `new`. Both  
  Create-and-destroy groups now list `destroy_slot`. Part 1 of the rules has a  
  new section, "How a Master acquires a mailbox or a pool" — one Slot per  
  resource, local to  
  `init`, detach on the next line, `errdefer` after it, field non-optional —  
  and the other three design-note findings landed in Parts 3 and 8. The two  
  classes of item are named in matryoshka-concepts-003.md and in  
  `language-of-matryoshka.md`, which was edited in place by the owner's ruling.  
  `context.md` has a new Superseded versions section, so the orphan gate passes  
  with nothing deleted. DONE 2026-08-14 (`check_design.sh` exit 0, 195/195).

- **API 13 Part 6** — the eleven cross-tool sections grouped into four:
  identity across the tools, the slot rule, concurrency and cancel, what the  
  toolkit assumes. Owner's ruling. The grouping demotes the eleven one level  
  and reorders them; no body text rewritten. DONE 2026-08-13 (195/195).

- **API 13-2** — the code takes the detail. All 43 carry-over rows are `///` or
  `//!` comments in `src/polynode.zig`, `src/mailbox.zig` and `src/pool.zig`.  
  Doc comments only, no behaviour change. Each of the four modules points at  
  its own examples root plus `/examples/flow/`, roots only; no snippet in  
  `src/`. Three things the code did not back are in Section 5 of  
  [api-13-carryover-004.md](api-13-carryover-004.md). DONE 2026-08-13  
  (195/195).

- **API 13-3** — the book sheds the detail. 2062 lines to 2022. The line it cut
  on: a precondition the caller satisfies stays, the assert mechanism goes. All  
  nine `Assert:` blocks gone, with the two-checks-per-insert reasoning, the  
  safety-build cost, the `concatByMoving` and header-consistency explanations,  
  the `!is_linked` site list, the `in_pool_count` lock mechanics and the  
  reentrancy reasoning. The `init` null-tag clause was deleted, not moved — no  
  such assert exists. Kept against their row by the owner's ruling: the OOB  
  diagram, the trimmed `popFirst` warning, the two behavioural contracts.  
  DONE 2026-08-13 (195/195).

- **API 13-4a** — the prose pass over `src/*.zig`. Three voice lines brought to
  the owner and all kept. Custody wording reworded across 29 sites, the MBOX 1  
  statement with them. Six mailbox summary lines replaced, so the autodoc  
  module page no longer shows six identical rows; "item" chosen over "handle".  
  Headers modelled on `std.Io`'s — `mailbox.zig` 52 lines to 26, `pool.zig` 49  
  to 25. Thirteen multi-fact sentences split. DONE 2026-08-13 (195/195).

- **API 13-4b-1** — the documents that contradicted `src/`. Six new versions, 11
  kitchen pages, `STATUS.md` and `context.md`. The rules carve-out for the old  
  mailbox statement retired; the carry-over note's finding discharged. Owner's  
  ruling: the Hold vocabulary in the architecture doc is out of scope, because  
  it replaced a banned family of words and names sections and the `HELD` state.  
  Post-stage cleanup: two comment-level fixes, three code-level findings  
  reported and not actioned. DONE 2026-08-13 (195/195).

- **API 13-1** — the api reference becomes a book. Seven parts from 22 flat
  `##` headings; Parts 3, 4 and 5 share one five-piece shape. New Part 1  
  (introduction) and Part 2 (intrusion, type erasure, `ParentHandle`), whose  
  snippets come from a new permanent test, `tests/zig_mechanisms.zig`. Every  
  snippet in Parts 2-5 is extracted from a file a kitchen script builds, and  
  names its source. Pool gains a `Hooks` section one level above Get and Put.  
  475 lines of manual definition and `PolyHelper` walkthrough replaced by  
  pointers to the two kitchen pages that already carry them; the complexity  
  table deleted; bare signature lists replaced by grouped signatures with  
  descriptions. The stale "this file is the source for `///` comments" note  
  and the dead `Addendums → Io 101` pointer both fixed. Detail stays in  
  the book and is recorded in  
  [api-13-carryover-004.md](api-13-carryover-004.md) — 43 rows.  
  `ParentHandle` added to the glossary.  
  DONE 2026-08-13 (195/195).

CANDIDATES was dropped, owner's decision. It carried from plan-043 through  
plan-046 without starting, and `design/candidates/` does not exist on disk.

---

## Next

**Nothing is authorized.** The owner names the stage.

**The recommended next step is the audit that ranks the parked work.** Owner's  
ruling, 2026-08-14: INTR 8 runs first, and the whole parked list is re-ranked  
after it. INTR 8 is now closed, so the audit is unblocked.

- Its input is the PARKED WORK block at the top of [STATUS.md](STATUS.md).
- Its output is a ruling, which goes into Next and lets that block be deleted.
- It is a decision about ordering. It changes no code.

What it ranks:

- **The API 13-4 close-out.** Four Part 0 checklist steps are still unrun —
  6, 7, 9 and 10. Steps 2 and 3 have since passed green twice, in INTR 8-2 and  
  again in 8-3, so only the report-and-approve steps are left: the patterns  
  scan, the banned-word scan, the README sync and the rules audit. Each reports  
  to the owner and fixes nothing without approval.
- **`polynode` audit** — never audited, and the other two layers stand on it.
- **13-4b-3** — the prose pass over `design/`. Detail below.
- **13-5 — the book governs.** Detail below.
- **Three code-level findings** from the 13-4 cleanup, in "Reported, not
  actioned".
- **The rendered autodoc page**, still unviewed. The plan makes it the
  verification for 13-4. `kitchen/tools/preview_apidocs.sh`.
- **`handle` vs `item`** in `mailbox.zig` body text, undecided.

**Recommendation on record, 2026-08-13, still unruled:** the `polynode` audit is  
worth more than 13-4b-3 or 13-5. Two audited layers stand on an unaudited one,  
which is a correctness gap; 13-4b-3 is polish with a heavy versioning tax. INTR  
8-3 added one argument for it — every doc 13-4b-3 versions now also adds a line  
to the Superseded versions section of `context.md`. One thing against it:  
`src/polynode.zig` carries the owner's own doc-comment edits.

**Also open, and cheap to close:** Open Item 14. It has a working resolution  
now, not a conflict. A ruling closes it; without one it is re-litigated every  
stage.

**FLOW is postponed.** FLOW 1-2 and FLOW 1-3 are not the next work. Owner's  
call, 2026-08-13. Their scope is unchanged and below.

---

---

## FLOW 1 — the usual flow of a mailbox and a pool

The gap FLOW 1 closed: every doc described the edges, none described the  
ordinary path. `new`, `init(hooks)`, `destroy` and close-before-destroy were  
documented only as hazards, or not at all.

- **FLOW 1-1** — the canonical text, written into the api reference.
  DONE 2026-08-12. Wording rejected by the owner on 2026-08-13.
- **FLOW 1-1r** — the same text in staccato, approved. DONE 2026-08-13.
  Every numbered step is a heading line with nested bullets under it.

The canonical text now lives in Parts 4 and 5 of
[matryoshka-api-reference-042.md](matryoshka-api-reference-042.md), carried
into the book unchanged by API 13-1.

**1-2 and 1-3 are postponed.** Owner's call, 2026-08-13. Their scope is below  
and unchanged.

Vocabulary, owner's ruling 2026-08-12: `lifecycle` is AI-sh, and the section is  
called **Usual flow** everywhere. `hands` and `holds` stay out of new text.

Superseded by the owner's ruling of 2026-08-13, in API 13-4: the custody sense of  
both words is reworded wherever it appears, and the MBOX 1 framing goes with it.  
`src/mailbox.zig` now reads "The mailbox keeps items. It never touches them."  
Scoped away from the Hold vocabulary in
[matryoshka-architecture-foundation-4-006.md](matryoshka-architecture-foundation-4-006.md),
which stays.

### FLOW 1-2 — propagate

Mechanical, once 1-1 is approved. Nothing here invents wording.

- `src/mailbox.zig` and `src/pool.zig` `//!` headers — a condensed Usual flow,
  roughly ten lines each, placed directly after the opening bullets and  
  before the edge rules. The ordinary path is read first by anyone who stops  
  after ten lines. Doc comments only, no behaviour change, so this stays  
  inside the report-only policy for `src/`.
- `kitchen/docs/api/mailbox/index.md` — new Usual flow section, the one it
  never had.
- `kitchen/docs/api/pool/index.md` — repair the existing diagram: add `init`
  and `destroy`, rename the heading to Usual flow.
- `kitchen/docs/tools/mailbox.md`, `kitchen/docs/tools/pool.md` — the reader-
  facing version, and the `hands` reword.

Kitchen pages are edited in place; they are not versioned.  
Gates: `build_and_test_debug.sh` 191/191, `check_design.sh`, `build_site.sh`.

### FLOW 1-3 — the whole picture

The page that does not exist anywhere: a mailbox and a pool in one  
application, and which one is the right choice for a given problem.

New page under `kitchen/docs/tools/`, plus a nav entry in `mkdocs.yml`.  
Scope it when 1-1 and 1-2 are done, not now.

### Out of scope

The pool re-audit, the `polynode` audit, and everything else on the deferred  
list. Renaming Layer 1 example 022 — still owner-only, still a `git mv`.

---

## API 13 — the reference becomes a book

Design note: [api-13-book-002.md](api-13-book-002.md). It carries the reason,  
the eight findings, the seven-part structure, the displacement table and the  
deliverables, with the owner's rulings on `-001` folded into the sections they  
govern.

The direction reversed. The reference was the source for `src/` doc comments;  
the code is working now, so the code takes the detail and the book keeps what a  
reader learning Matryoshka needs.

### 13-4b-2 — DROPPED 2026-08-13

Defined from symmetry with 13-4a, not from evidence. A scan of the 59  
hand-maintained kitchen pages found one line over 180 characters  
(`kitchen/docs/addendums/intrusion-type-erasure.md`) and one multi-fact sentence in a  
generated page. Those pages were written in staccato and never accumulated the  
prose `src/` did. The long line goes to 13-5.

### 13-4b-3 — the `design/` documents, prose

The versioning rule makes this the expensive half. Every doc touched needs a new  
suffixed version plus a link cascade, and a bulk repoint must name its files and  
exclude `STATUS-LOG.md`.

Two carried items, both the owner's:

- `handle` vs `item` in `mailbox.zig` body text. It runs 29 to 18 for `handle`
  while the rest of the repo runs 6:1 the other way. The summary lines already  
  say "item", so single comments now use both.
- `language-of-matryoshka.md` is unsuffixed, against "all docs require one". Its
  one custody-adjacent hit is mechanism sense. Left out of 13-4b-1 for both  
  reasons.

### API 13-5 — the book governs

### API 13-5 — the book governs, continued

- The book dictates the content of every other doc.
- Read the neighbours for material that belongs in the book:
  [matryoshka-concepts-003.md](matryoshka-concepts-003.md) and
  [patterns-029.md](patterns-029.md) overlap it most.
- Reconcile `kitchen/docs/api/pool/hooks-discipline.md`. The book's Hooks
  section states the same rules. Decide whether the page keeps its own text or  
  becomes a pointer.
- The carry-over note's "to remove later" section is discharged here or by an
  owner decision — the slogan register, and the banned word Section 3 of that  
  note counts.
- Move material in, move material out, record both.

---

## Deferred — owner's call on order

- A top-level `matryoshka.destroy_slot`. Captured by INTR 8, not built. It can
  never be universal, and if it ships it uses the Slot convention rather than a  
  panic. Reasoning in [intr-8-slot-based-creation-003.md](intr-8-slot-based-creation-003.md),  
  "Rejected".
- Pool re-audit. `audit_edges.sh` reports 69 bare `pl.put(&slot)` statements —
  real give-back edges, unaudited, since INTR 7 predates this framing.
- `polynode` audit — the layer the other two stand on, never audited.
- Diagram-notation scan.
- Showcase-post variants (Ziggit, Discord, Reddit).
- Editorial/conceptual prose pass from REBRAND (README intro, manifesto).
- DISPATCH 1: run the repro matrix on zig 0.15.2, get a real 0.17.0-dev
  diagnostic, file the bug upstream to ziglang/zig.
- API 8a Q25's protection list, answered "postpone decision". The migration ran
  with the three proposed protections applied as written. Worth a look before  
  the next stage that touches list code.

---

## Reported, not actioned

- **From PROSE 1.** Layer 1 example 022 still carries a banned word in its
  file name, and the matching `pub const` in `examples/layer1/layer1.zig` and  
  the call in `tests/layer1_examples.zig` carry it with them. Renaming a file  
  is a `git mv` and cascades into the generated example page and the examples  
  index. Owner-only, and already on record there as unchanged by decision.
- **From PROSE 1.** `check_design.sh` glossary conformance rejects a changelog
  row that names a banned word, even one written to record that word's  
  removal. Older rows predate the gate and are grandfathered. Anything new  
  must describe the change without using the word.
- **From AUDIT 1.** The documented-assert check could be a hard gate in
  `check_design.sh`. It is report-only in `audit_edges.sh` today. Making it  
  block a stage is an owner decision and was not taken.
- **Closed by MBOX 1's follow-up.** The stack-frame items in
  `tests/layer2_mailbox.zig` are gone. Owner chose heap items over a rule  
  exemption, so Part 8 holds with no carve-out.
- **From MBOX 1.** The 101 `try mbx.send(&slot)` sites were left as they are.
  Each propagates `error.Closed` with the item still in the slot, and each is  
  covered today by a `defer` on the slot or by the mailbox being provably  
  open. Nothing to fix, but it is the shape that goes wrong first when an  
  example is copied into a real system.
- `Io.Select.awaitMany` is used and documented nowhere in the repo. It is
  the natural pair for any batch-receive work.
- `src/pool.zig` carries an uncommitted owner edit made before API 6
  (`get_wait` doc comment now states "does not call on_get hook").
- **Closed by DOC 23.** The stale `helpers/`-path references reported outside
  INTR 6's scope are gone. Re-checked 2026-08-02: the only `helpers/` mentions  
  left under `kitchen/docs/` are `@import` lines inside generated example  
  pages, which are correct. The `design/` side was closed by DOC 22.
- **Closed by the 2026-07-30 banned-word pass.** The `patterns-017` section
  titles carried from `-016`/`-015` are reworded in `patterns-029.md`, and the  
  `022-ownership_transfer.zig` `//!` title and entry-point name are reworded  
  too. The **filename** still carries the word — owner's decision, since  
  renaming trips the examples-catalog nav-sync rule.
- Working tree carries uncommitted owner edits to `README.md` and
  `design/secondary/mtk-readme.md`, a deleted SPDX header in  
  `src/internal/cond_timeout.zig`, and a deleted  
  `design/stories/photo-archive-pipeline.png` alongside two untracked  
  `-001.png`/`-002.png`. Left alone. The story narrative references no image.
