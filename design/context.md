# Matryoshka Zig — Context Entry Point

## Writing rules
- Short intro, then bullets. Like staccato music.
- One fact per bullet.
- No prose paragraphs with comma-separated lists.

## What this file is

One line per doc: the link, then what the doc is.

Not a changelog. How a doc reached its current version is narrative, and  
narrative lives in [STATUS-LOG.md](STATUS-LOG.md). See rules-049.md,  
"Status file ownership".

`design/` holds the current picture of Matryoshka. Snapshots, superseded  
drafts, session logs and unstarted intentions live in  
[secondary/](secondary/context.md) and are frozen. See rules-049.md,  
"Where a doc lives".

## State

- [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) — where we are and what is next. Read in full each session.
- [matryoshka-ztk-implementation-plan-074.md](matryoshka-ztk-implementation-plan-074.md) — forward-looking work + one line per completed stage.
- [STATUS-LOG.md](STATUS-LOG.md) — session narrative, by date. Do not read by default.

## Sources of truth

- [matryoshka-api-reference-042.md](matryoshka-api-reference-042.md) — the book. Seven parts: introduction, the Zig mechanisms, then one part each for polynode, mailbox and pool in the same five-piece shape, the cross-tool material, and what sits beyond the toolkit. Signatures, types, error sets, preconditions and the cancel contract live in the three tool parts. The assert mechanism does not — that is in `src/` doc comments.
- [rules-049.md](rules-049.md) — coding, doc, and process rules. Includes the banned-word list.
- [patterns-029.md](patterns-029.md) — unified pattern and idiom catalog.
- [matryoshka-zig-0.16-notes-003.md](matryoshka-zig-0.16-notes-003.md) — Zig 0.16 constraints, the cancellation contract, and what comptime bought.

## Concepts

- [matryoshka-concepts-003.md](matryoshka-concepts-003.md) — what Matryoshka is: why it exists, the one constraint, Master as an Io task, the four concepts, the who-holds-it mantra, the three-category model, where Io fits.
- [matryoshka-architecture-foundation-4-006.md](matryoshka-architecture-foundation-4-006.md) — four layers (Hold/Movement/Lifecycle/Coordination), hold states, concurrency contract, infrastructure as items, design decisions, non-goals.
- [language-of-matryoshka.md](language-of-matryoshka.md) — vocabulary. Where another doc differs, this one wins.

## Design notes

- [item-list-011.md](item-list-011.md) — `ItemList` and intrusive safety. The question record behind API 8, 9 and 10.
- [receive-router-002.md](receive-router-002.md) — receive-router use case and chosen solution.
- [table-dispatch-002.md](table-dispatch-002.md) — table dispatch: the handler belongs to the pair (receiver, tag).
- [api-12-real-pointers-005.md](api-12-real-pointers-005.md) — API 12: Mbox/Pool as real pointers, replacing MailboxHandle/PoolHandle.
- [api-13-book-002.md](api-13-book-002.md) — API 13: the api reference becomes a standalone book for the user, and the detail moves into `src/` doc comments. Current version, with the owner's rulings on `-001` folded in.
- [api-13-carryover-004.md](api-13-carryover-004.md) — API 13: what left the book, and where it goes. Landed in `src/` by 13-2, still the input for 13-3. Carries the slogan register, the banned-word footprint, and what 13-2 found the code did not back.
- [intr-8-slot-based-creation-003.md](intr-8-slot-based-creation-003.md) — INTR 8: `new` fills a Slot, `Pool.init` folds into `pool.new`, `destroy_slot` checks inside, and the two classes of item are named. Carries what was rejected and why.
- [audit-recipe-002.md](audit-recipe-002.md) — how to audit a layer for items the toolkit gives back. Method behind INTR 7 and MBOX 1, with the current baseline. Tool: `kitchen/tools/audit_edges.sh`.

## Tests and examples

- [task1-tests-008.md](task1-tests-008.md) — Layers 1-3, 84 scenarios.
- [task2-tests-004.md](task2-tests-004.md) — Layer 4, 16 scenarios: worker lifecycle, shutdown, cancellation.
- [task1-examples-006.md](task1-examples-006.md) — Layers 1-4, 29 scenarios. Index only; the description lives in each source file's doc comment.
- [task2-examples-007.md](task2-examples-007.md) — Layer 4 + cross-layer, 48 scenarios. Index only.

## Stories

- [stories/video-transcoder-004.md](stories/video-transcoder-004.md) — massive-scale transcoder. Pool as backpressure signal, transfer routing.
- [stories/print-server-003.md](stories/print-server-003.md) — network print server. Client, spooler, device.
- [stories/photo-archive-pipeline.md](stories/photo-archive-pipeline.md) — photo archive: album, grid, search and full-size views. Diagrams: `stories/photo-archive-pipeline-001.png` and `stories/photo-archive-pipeline-002.png`.

## Documentation

- [matryoshka-Ztk-diagram-style-guide-003.md](matryoshka-Ztk-diagram-style-guide-003.md) — diagram notation and style.
- [../kitchen/defer/matryoshka-storytelling-003.md](../kitchen/defer/matryoshka-storytelling-003.md) — storytelling rhythm: Discussion, SRS, Translation, Central Insight.
- [../kitchen/notes.md](../kitchen/notes.md) — running notes on `kitchen/` tooling. Not versioned, edit in place.

## Superseded versions

Kept as historical record. Owner's ruling, 2026-08-14.

Part 0 of rules-049.md forbids deleting them, and `check_design.sh` reports any  
unlisted `design/` file as an orphan. One line here satisfies both. Nothing in  
`design/` is deleted to pass the gate.

The rule, in full: a superseded version stays on disk and gets one line in this  
section, naming what replaced it. See Decisions in STATUS.md.

Read the current version instead. These are here so nothing is lost.

- [matryoshka-tk-implementation-plan-072.md](matryoshka-tk-implementation-plan-072.md) — superseded by -073.
- [matryoshka-tk-implementation-plan-073.md](matryoshka-tk-implementation-plan-073.md) — superseded by matryoshka-ztk-implementation-plan-074.md.
- [matryoshka-concepts-002.md](matryoshka-concepts-002.md) — superseded by -003.

## Secondary

- [secondary/context.md](secondary/context.md) — index of the frozen material: cookbook structure, the DOC-stage docs plan, docs tooling, the README draft, the Odin idiom mapping, the pointer-switch compiler bug and its repro, the two transcoder notation experiments, the print-server analysis.
