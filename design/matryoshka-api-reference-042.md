# Matryoshka — the book

For Zig 0.16.

Read it to learn Matryoshka. Read it to use Matryoshka.

Seven parts. Parts 3, 4 and 5 have the same shape, in the same order.

- **What this is** — high level, short.
- **Participants** — the types, and the role each one plays.
- **Usual flow** — the regular usage.
- **The API, in named groups** — one named group per act.
- **Where to go deeper** — `src/`, an example, a page on the docs site.

A part learned once is a part learned everywhere.

Deep dive is not this book's job. For that the reader goes to `src/`, to an  
example, or to the docs site.

Base of the docs site: `https://g41797.github.io/matryoshka-ztk/`.

---

## Part 1 — Introduction

### What Matryoshka is

An item-transfer and item-reuse toolkit for concurrent Zig programs.

Three small tools. Each one usable on its own.

- **polynode** — type identity for an item.
- **mailbox** — transfer of an item between tasks.
- **pool** — reuse of an item, decided by your hooks.

Mailbox and pool are both optional. polynode alone is a valid use.

### What it is for

One idea runs through all three.

- Share by communicating.
- Do not share access to an item. Move the item.
- One place has the item at a time.

That gives a concurrent program without locks around application data.

- The mailbox is shared. The items passing through it are not.
- The pool is shared. The items it gives out are not.

### Who it is for

- A Zig programmer building a concurrent subsystem.
- Someone who wants transfer and reuse without a framework around them.
- Someone who wants to read the whole toolkit in an afternoon.

### What it is not

Plain scope limits.

- Not an async runtime. `std.Io` is the runtime. Matryoshka is given an `Io`.
- Not a queue library. The mailbox transfers items. It does not copy or
  serialize them.
- Not an allocator, and not a garbage collector. Every item is allocated and
  released by your code, or by your hooks.
- Not a storage container. The pool answers whether a reusable item is
  available right now.
- Not a coordinator. There is no `Master` type. Part 7 says why.

### What the reader needs before starting

- Zig 0.16.
- `std.DoublyLinkedList`, and what an intrusive list is. Part 2 gives it.
- `@fieldParentPtr`. Part 2 gives it.
- `std.Io`, for mailbox and pool. Only the basics — an `Io` value is created
  and passed in.

---

## Part 2 — Zig, interesting parts

### Why this part exists

These are the parts of Zig that Matryoshka is built out of.

- Not Zig trivia.
- Not a teaching document. It is short.
- Its job is to make Part 3 cheap to read.

A reader who wants the full treatment goes to the Zig documentation.

Everything here is standard Zig. Nothing in this part is a Matryoshka  
invention. One term is ours, and this part says which one.

The demonstration is a real test file: `tests/zig_mechanisms.zig`. It imports  
nothing from Matryoshka. Every snippet below is taken from it.

### Intrusion — the links are part of the struct

<a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.16.0/std/#std.DoublyLinkedList" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">std.DoublyLinkedList</a>  
works on  
<a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.16.0/std/#std.DoublyLinkedList.Node" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nodes</a>.

Two steps, and that is the whole mechanism.

- Embed a `Node` in your struct.
- Use the `std.DoublyLinkedList` functions.

```zig
/// A parent struct with the list links embedded in it.
const Reading = struct {
    node: std.DoublyLinkedList.Node = .{},
    value: i32 = 0,
};
```

The Node already carries the pointers. So the list:

- allocates no wrapper for your struct
- follows links that live inside your struct

```zig
var a: Reading = .{ .value = 1 };
var b: Reading = .{ .value = 2 };

// Nothing is allocated here. The list header is one struct, and every
// link it follows lives inside a Reading.
var list: std.DoublyLinkedList = .{};
list.append(&a.node);
list.append(&b.node);
```

Source: `tests/zig_mechanisms.zig`, scenario B1.

**Intrusion** — the links are part of the struct.

---


### Type erasure — the list works on Node

---


`std.DoublyLinkedList` does not care:

- what the type of the parent struct is
- whether the structs in one list have the same type

```zig
var r: Reading = .{ .value = 7 };
var l: Label = .{ .text = "seven" };

var list: std.DoublyLinkedList = .{};
list.append(&r.node);
list.append(&l.node);

// The list took both. It never asked what the parent type was.
```

Source: `tests/zig_mechanisms.zig`, scenario B2.

**Type erasure** — the list operates on `Node`, not on the concrete type.

---


### ParentHandle — the way back

---

- Your code works with the `*Reading`.
- The list is passed the `*Node`.
- Zig does not guarantee that *Reading and *Node are the same.

---


[`@fieldParentPtr`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.16.0/#toc-fieldParentPtr) provides "cast".

---

*Node is used for 2 different things:

- for list operations
- for calculation of address of parent structure

The purpose of _ParentHandle_ is to clarify usage of *Node for 

- calculation
- or for any operation except list ones


```zig
/// A `ParentHandle` is a pointer to the embedded Node.
/// (*Node alias)
const ParentHandle = *std.DoublyLinkedList.Node;

/// From the handle to the parent struct T.
///
fn parentOf(comptime T: type, handle: ParentHandle) *T {
    return @fieldParentPtr("node", handle);
}
```

---

```zig
    const readingHandle: ParentHandle = list.popFirst() orelse unreachable;
    const labelHandle: ParentHandle = list.popFirst() orelse unreachable;

    try testing.expectEqual(@as(i32, 7), parentOf(Reading, readingHandle).*.value);
    try testing.expectEqualStrings("seven", parentOf(Label, labelHandle).*.text);
```


Source: `tests/zig_mechanisms.zig`.

`ParentHandle` is the term this book uses.

- The mechanism is part of Zig — a `*Node`, plus `@fieldParentPtr`.
- Only the name is ours. This book needed a word for it.

---


### Why the caller must check before casting

---


The cast is unchecked. Both of these compile, and both run.

```zig
const as_label: *Label = parentOf(Label, handle);
const as_reading: *Reading = parentOf(Reading, handle);
```

Source: `tests/zig_mechanisms.zig`, scenario B3.

Only one of them is right.

- A `Label` read as a `Reading` gives whatever bytes sit where `value` would be.
- Zig does not check it.
- The handle carries nothing to check against.

So the caller has to know the type by other means — the order it inserted  
items in, a separate list per type, or a field of its own.

This is the gap polynode closes. Part 3 starts there.

---


### Where to go deeper

---


- `tests/zig_mechanisms.zig` — the four scenarios, runnable.
- [Intrusion and Type erasure](https://g41797.github.io/matryoshka-ztk/addendums/intrusion-type-erasure/) — the same terms, one page.
- The Zig documentation, for `std.DoublyLinkedList` and `@fieldParentPtr`.

---

## Part 3 — polynode

---


### What this is

Type identity for an item.

Part 2 ended on an unchecked cast. polynode makes it checked.

- A tag sits next to the embedded node.
- The tag says what the parent type is.
- The check happens on the handle, not in the caller's head.


### Participants

```zig
pub const PolyTag = struct { _: u8 = 0 };

pub const PolyNode = struct {
    node: std.DoublyLinkedList.Node,
    tag:  *const anyopaque,
};

pub const ItemHandle = *PolyNode;
pub const Slot = ?ItemHandle;
pub const ItemList = struct { ... };
```

- `PolyNode` — the intrusive struct. A `std.DoublyLinkedList.Node`, plus a tag.
- `ItemHandle` — a pointer to an embedded `PolyNode`. One item.
  - This is the analog of Part 2's `ParentHandle`, with the tag added.
  - Everything Matryoshka transports is an `ItemHandle`.
- `Slot` — `?ItemHandle`. Where a handle lives while it is yours. Zero or one
  item.
- `ItemList` — many items.
- `PolyHelper(T)` — generates the tag and the casts for one type `T`.

A Slot holds a handle, or it is empty.

```text
Slot (holds a handle)            Empty Slot

+-------------------+            +-------------------+
|                   |            |                   |
|    ItemHandle     |            |       null        |
|                   |            |                   |
+-------------------+            +-------------------+

  Slot = ?ItemHandle               Slot = null
```

Everything transported is an `ItemHandle`:

- events
- requests
- mailboxes
- pools

A mailbox and a pool are items too. Part 4 and Part 5 say how.

### Usual flow

Three steps. Define a type, transport it, recover it.

```zig
// 1. Define. One embedded field, one generated helper.
pub const Message = struct {
    poly: polynode.PolyNode = .{},
    text: []const u8 = "",
    priority: u8 = 0,
};

pub const MessagePolyHelper = polynode.PolyHelper(Message);

// 2. Transport. init sets the tag, toPoly reaches the node.
var msg: Message = .{ .text = "hello", .priority = 1 };
MessagePolyHelper.init(&msg);

const handle: polynode.ItemHandle = MessagePolyHelper.toPoly(&msg);

// 3. Recover. fromPoly checks the tag first, and returns null on mismatch.
const back: *Message = MessagePolyHelper.fromPoly(handle) orelse
    return error.WrongTag;
```

Source: `examples/layer1/021-define_type.zig`.

1. **Define.**
   - Embed a `PolyNode` field. The field is called `poly`.
   - Generate the helper with `PolyHelper(T)`.
   - Nothing else is required of the struct.
2. **Transport.**
   - `init` sets the tag. On a stack value, with no allocator.
   - `toPoly` gives the `ItemHandle`.
   - The handle travels. The tag travels with it.
3. **Recover.**
   - `fromPoly` checks the tag, then casts.
   - It returns `null` when the tag belongs to another type.
   - The caller decides what a mismatch means.

Recovery from a list is the same call, one step later.

```zig
while (list.popFirst()) |poly| {
    if (items.Event.EventPolyHelper.fromPoly(poly)) |recovered_ev| {
        // an Event
    } else if (items.Sensor.SensorPolyHelper.fromPoly(poly)) |recovered_sn| {
        // a Sensor
    } else {
        return error.UnknownTag;
    }
}
```

Source: `examples/layer1/023-tag_dispatch.zig`.

### Identity

The tag is the identity.

- `PolyHelper(T)` creates one static `PolyTag` per type `T`, at comptime.
- `TAG` is a pointer to that static — the same address for every instance of
  `T`.
- A tag comparison is a pointer comparison. Nothing is read from the item.

```zig
pub const TAG: *const anyopaque
pub inline fn isIt(tag: *const anyopaque) bool
```

- `TAG` — the runtime type ID of `T`.
- `isIt` — true when the tag identifies `T`.

The tag answers one question: **is this a T?**

- It does not answer "which T?"
- It does not answer "what role does this T play?"
- Part 6 says what to do when the role matters.

Read-only operations never move a handle.

- tag checks
- typed casts
- `@fieldParentPtr` recovery

### Links

```zig
pub fn reset(n: *PolyNode) void
```

- Clears intrusive link pointers (`prev`, `next` to null).
- `ItemList.popFirst` calls it for you. Needed by hand only for
  `ItemList._list`.

```zig
pub fn is_linked(n: *PolyNode) bool
```

- Returns true if the node has neighbours (`prev` or `next` is set).
- Not a membership test. `std.DoublyLinkedList` never sets the links of a
  list's only member, so a list of exactly one reports false.
- A false result means nothing about whether the item is kept somewhere.

### Lists

`ItemList` is the toolkit's list type.

- It holds a `std.DoublyLinkedList` inside.
- It speaks `ItemHandle` outside.
- Say what it adds to a list, and nothing about what a list is.

What it adds:

- Every entry point takes and returns `ItemHandle`, never `&x.poly.node`.
- `popFirst`, `popLast` and `remove` call `polynode.reset` before returning.
  A popped handle is never linked.
- Under runtime safety every insert asserts on the new item.
- `appendFromSlot` and `prependFromSlot` empty a Slot in one call.

Where it appears in the other two parts:

- Returned by `Mbox.receive_batch` and `Mbox.close`.
- Taken by `Pool.put_all`.
- Carried by `Pool.Hooks.on_put` and `Pool.Hooks.on_close`.

**Insert.**

```zig
pub fn append(self: *ItemList, ih: ItemHandle) void
pub fn prepend(self: *ItemList, ih: ItemHandle) void
pub fn appendFromSlot(self: *ItemList, slot: *Slot) void
pub fn prependFromSlot(self: *ItemList, slot: *Slot) void
pub fn insertAfter(self: *ItemList, existing: ItemHandle, ih: ItemHandle) void
pub fn insertBefore(self: *ItemList, existing: ItemHandle, ih: ItemHandle) void
```

- `append`, `prepend`, `insertAfter`, `insertBefore` take `ItemHandle` — no
  `&x.poly.node`.
- `appendFromSlot` / `prependFromSlot` take the item out of a `Slot` and leave
  it empty. Use them whenever the item is in a Slot; `append` and `prepend`  
  stay for a stack item, which has no Slot to empty.
- Both need a Slot that holds an item. An insert is not a `defer` target, so it
  follows `Mbox.send` rather than `Pool.put`.
- An item may be inserted once, into one list. `insertAfter` / `insertBefore`
  also need `existing` to be in this list.
- Safety builds check both, at a cost. Release builds do not check and do not
  pay.

**Take out.**

```zig
pub fn popFirst(self: *ItemList) ?ItemHandle
pub fn popLast(self: *ItemList) ?ItemHandle
pub fn remove(self: *ItemList, ih: ItemHandle) void
```

- `popFirst` returns `?ItemHandle` and calls `polynode.reset` before returning.
  A popped handle is never linked.
- `popLast` is the same at the other end.
- `remove` takes one item out wherever it sits, and calls `polynode.reset` too.
  Use it instead of reaching into `_list`. This list must hold the item.

**Inspect.**

```zig
pub fn first(self: *const ItemList) ?ItemHandle
pub fn last(self: *const ItemList) ?ItemHandle
pub fn isEmpty(self: *const ItemList) bool
pub fn len(self: *const ItemList) usize
pub fn iterator(self: *const ItemList) Iterator
```

- `first` / `last` return `?ItemHandle` and remove nothing. A list of one
  returns the same item from both.
- `len` forwards std's walk. O(n). Do not call it in a loop.
- `iterator` walks without removing. Items stay linked, no `reset`.

```zig
pub fn next(self: *Iterator) ?ItemHandle
```

- Non-destructive. Yields each `ItemHandle` in order, removes nothing.

**Move whole lists.**

```zig
pub fn concat(self: *ItemList, other: *ItemList) void
pub fn moveFromList(list: *std.DoublyLinkedList) ItemList
pub fn moveToList(self: *ItemList) std.DoublyLinkedList
```

- `concat` moves every item of `other` in and leaves `other` empty.
- `concat` on the same list twice returns early and does nothing. The plain
  `concatByMoving` would lose every item in it.
- `moveFromList` / `moveToList` cross to a plain std list. Both empty the
  source, both O(1). There is no copy form — a header copy aliases.

**The plain list inside — `_list`.**

- Use the `ItemList` methods instead. Tests that manipulate raw links use this
  field.
- An item taken out this way keeps its old `prev`/`next`. `popFirst` did not
  run, so `polynode.reset` did not either — call it yourself.

**Warning — the two `popFirst` calls differ.**

- `std.DoublyLinkedList.popFirst()` leaves the node's `prev`/`next` set.
  `ItemList.popFirst()` clears them.
- After popping from the plain list, call `polynode.reset(poly)` yourself.
  Skip it and the item looks linked to everything that checks.

There is no adapter and no custom node type. Every PolyNode-based item carries  
the standard intrusive links, so a plain `std.DoublyLinkedList` accepts it.

### Generation

`PolyHelper(T)` writes the identity code for one type.

```zig
pub const MessagePolyHelper = polynode.PolyHelper(Message);
```

What it saves you: the tag, the checked casts, and the two heap calls.

**Tag and check.**

```zig
pub const TAG: *const anyopaque
pub inline fn isIt(tag: *const anyopaque) bool
pub inline fn init(self: *T) void
```

- `init` sets the embedded `PolyNode` — the tag, and empty links.

**Across the border, both ways.**

```zig
pub inline fn toPoly(self: *T) *PolyNode
pub inline fn fromPoly(node: *PolyNode) ?*T
pub inline fn mustFromPoly(node: *PolyNode) *T
```

- `toPoly` — the way in. Cannot fail; `T` is known at compile time.
- `fromPoly` — the way out. Checks the tag, returns `null` on mismatch, never
  modifies the node.
- `mustFromPoly` — the same, and panics on mismatch. For a call site that has
  already established the type.

**Through a Slot.**

```zig
pub inline fn fromSlot(slot: *const Slot) ?*T
pub inline fn mustFromSlot(slot: *const Slot) *T
pub inline fn moveFromSlot(slot: *Slot) ?*T
```

- `fromSlot` — `null` when the Slot is empty or holds another type. Does not
  empty the Slot.
- `mustFromSlot` — the same, and panics on failure.
- `moveFromSlot` — takes `T` out. On success the Slot is left empty. On failure
  the Slot is unchanged.

**Heap.**

```zig
pub fn create(allocator: std.mem.Allocator, slot: *Slot) !void
pub fn destroy(allocator: std.mem.Allocator, slot: *Slot) void
```

- `create` allocates `T`, sets the tag, and stores the handle in the Slot.
- `destroy` releases the item in the Slot, and empties the Slot. It does
  nothing on an empty Slot, which is what makes defer-before-acquisition safe.
- Never call `allocator.create` / `allocator.destroy` directly on a
  PolyNode-based type. Part 6 lists the exemptions.

**Types with their own allocation — `no_create_destroy`.**

- A type that declares `no_create_destroy` gets a helper without `create` and
  `destroy`.
- Chosen at comptime, per type.
- For a type that allocates itself, such as a mailbox or a pool.

## Interlude: Item and ItemHandle

---

The documentation talks about _Item_.      
The API works with 

- an **ItemHandle**
- and **Slot** - "container" for ItemHandle

You are thinking in terms of:

- read _file_
- write _file_
- close _file_

on API level one of the arguments is _file handle_.

The same is for Matryoshka-Ztk API

- you are thinking in terms of _Item_ - Application entity
- API is working with _ItemHandle_/_Slot_ - Matryoshka-Ztk entity


---

## Part 4 — mailbox

---


### What this is

Transfer of items between tasks.

The mailbox keeps items. It never touches them.

- No inspection, no copy, no free.
- Internally a list of handles. It allocates and frees exactly one thing —
  itself.

So every item it holds goes back to a caller:

| edge | who ends up with the item |
|------|---------------------------|
| `receive`, `try_receive` | the receiver |
| `send`, `send_oob` returning `error.Closed` | the sender — the slot is unchanged |
| `receive_batch` | the caller, as a list |
| `close` | the caller, as a list |

Releasing them is the caller's job. Free them, or put them back into a pool —  
which one is knowledge the mailbox does not have and never had.

The mailbox does not care whether you closed it, except `destroy`. Every  
other method returns `error.Closed` and stays a valid object. `destroy`  
makes closedness a precondition and panics on an open mailbox.

Contrast with `pool`, which does touch items, through your hooks.

### Participants

```zig
const mailbox = @import("matryoshka").mailbox;

pub const Mbox = struct { ... };
```

- `Mbox` — the mailbox. Application code holds `*Mbox` and calls methods on
  it. The struct fields are internal.
- `Slot` — from polynode. Every send and every receive goes through one.
- `ItemList` — from polynode. What `receive_batch` and `close` give back.
- The `Io` it holds — passed to `mailbox.new`, kept, and used for every wait.

A mailbox is also a PolyNode — `toPoly`/`fromPoly` cross the border. A mailbox  
can be:

- sent through another mailbox
- stored in pools
- embedded into larger structures

Same rules as application items.

### Usual flow

Four steps. Two set up, two take down.

```zig
var mbx_slot: Slot = null;                // 1. create
try mailbox.new(io, alloc, &mbx_slot);
const mbx: *Mbox = Mbox.moveFromSlot(&mbx_slot).?;
defer mailbox.destroy(mbx, alloc);        // 4. free the mailbox itself

// 2. use it: send and receive, from any number of tasks
try mbx.send(&slot);
try mbx.receive(&slot, null);

// 3. close it, and release what comes back
var left = mbx.close();
items.freeList(&left, alloc);
```

1. **Create.**
   - `mailbox.new(io, alloc, &slot)` fills a Slot. It returns no pointer.
   - The Slot must be empty on entry. `new` asserts it.
   - On failure the Slot is left unchanged.
   - `Mbox.moveFromSlot(&slot)` takes the pointer out and empties the Slot.
     - Call it on the next line.
     - Nothing fallible belongs between the two.
     - This step is called **detaching**. The word is for reading; the call is
       `moveFromSlot`. `move` is the toolkit's word for every transfer of an  
       item, and a Slot is a place rather than a linkage, so nothing is  
       literally attached to one.
   - The Slot is a local. It dies where it was declared.
   - Internally the mailbox uses `Io` synchronisation objects.
   - `Io` should be Threaded.
2. **Use.**
   - Any task may send.
   - Any task may receive.
   - The mailbox is the only shared thing.
   - The items passing through it are never shared.
3. **Close.**
   - `close` returns an `ItemList`.
     - Everything still queued.
     - Regular and OOB together.
   - The list is yours. Release it.
     - Free the items.
     - Or put them back into a pool.
   - After `close`:
     - Every other method returns `error.Closed`.
     - The mailbox stays a valid object.
4. **Destroy.**
   - `mailbox.destroy(mbx, alloc)` frees the mailbox itself.
   - `mailbox.destroy_slot(&slot, alloc)` does the same from a Slot, and
     empties it.

Close before destroy.

- Always.
- `destroy` makes closedness a precondition.
- It panics on an open mailbox.

`destroy` is not optional.

- The items are one allocation. The mailbox is another.
- Releasing the list from `close` frees the items.
- Skipping `destroy` leaks the mailbox.

Teardown is the sharpest difference between the two.

- A mailbox returns its items to the caller.
- A pool passes them to `on_close`.

A full send and receive, in real code:

```zig
var mbx_slot: Slot = null;
try mailbox.new(io, allocator, &mbx_slot);
const mbx: *Mbox = Mbox.moveFromSlot(&mbx_slot).?;
defer {
    var rem: polynode.ItemList = mbx.close();
    items.freeList(&rem, allocator);
    mailbox.destroy(mbx, allocator);
}

{
    var slot: Slot = null;
    defer items.freeSlot(&slot, allocator);
    try items.Event.EventPolyHelper.create(allocator, &slot);
    items.Event.EventPolyHelper.mustFromSlot(&slot).code = 53;
    try mbx.send(&slot);
}

{
    var slot: Slot = null;
    defer items.freeSlot(&slot, allocator);
    try mbx.receive(&slot, 1_000_000_000);
    const ev_recv: *items.Event =
        items.Event.EventPolyHelper.fromSlot(&slot) orelse return error.WrongTag;
}
```

Source: `examples/layer2/053-simple_send_receive.zig`.

### Create and destroy

```zig
pub fn new(io: Io, alloc: std.mem.Allocator, slot: *polynode.Slot) !void
```

- Creates a mailbox and puts it in the Slot.
- The Slot must be empty on entry.
- The Slot is left unchanged if the creation fails.
- Stores `io` internally.

```zig
pub fn destroy(mbx: *Mbox, alloc: std.mem.Allocator) void
```

- Frees the mailbox.
- Must be closed first.
- Calling destroy on an open mailbox is a programming error (panic).

```zig
pub fn destroy_slot(slot: *polynode.Slot, alloc: std.mem.Allocator) void
```

- Frees the mailbox in the Slot, and empties the Slot.
- An empty Slot is a no-op. So is a second call on the same Slot.
- A Slot holding another type is a programming error (panic).
- Must be closed first, as `destroy` requires.

```zig
pub fn is_it_you(tag: *const anyopaque) bool
```

- Returns true if tag identifies a *Mbox.

### Send

The handle moves out of the sender's Slot.

```text
Before                           After

sender Slot                      sender Slot
+-------------------+            +-------------------+
|    ItemHandle     |            |       null        |
+-------------------+            +-------------------+

mbx.send(&slot)  ───►      Mailbox keeps ItemHandle
```

```zig
pub fn send(self: *Mbox, slot: *Slot) error{Closed}!void
```
- Appends handle to tail.
- Moves the handle — `slot.*` set to null.
- On `error.Closed` the slot is unchanged — the sender still has the item.
- The Slot must hold an item, and the item must not be in a list.

```zig
pub fn send_oob(self: *Mbox, slot: *Slot) error{Closed}!void
```
- Inserts handle after last OOB handle.
- FIFO among OOBs, all OOBs before regular handles.
- Moves the handle — `slot.*` set to null.
- Same two preconditions as `send`.

OOB ordering:

```text
send(R1), send(R2):       [R1, R2]                oob=0
send_oob(O1):             [O1, R1, R2]            oob=1
send(R3):                 [O1, R1, R2, R3]        oob=1
send_oob(O2):             [O1, O2, R1, R2, R3]   oob=2
receive → O1:             [O2, R1, R2, R3]        oob=1
receive → O2:             [R1, R2, R3]            oob=0
```

### Receive

The handle moves into the receiver's Slot.

```text
Before                           After

receiver Slot                    receiver Slot
+-------------------+            +-------------------+
|       null        |            |    ItemHandle     |
+-------------------+            +-------------------+

mbx.receive(&slot, null)   Receiver has ItemHandle
```

```zig
pub fn receive(self: *Mbox, slot: *Slot, timeout_ns: ?u64) (error{ Closed, Timeout, Wakeup } || Cancelable)!void
```
- Blocks until handle available.
- `null` timeout = wait forever.
- `timeout_ns = 0` returns `error.Timeout` immediately — equivalent to `try_receive`.
- Moves the handle — `slot.*` set to non-null.
- OOB handles arrive first (front of queue).
- `wakeUpAll()` called while blocked here — returns `error.Wakeup`, `slot.*` stays null.
- Multiple concurrent receivers compete for each handle.
- One receiver gets it.
- Order among waiters depends on the Io runtime — not guaranteed FIFO.
- The Slot must be empty.

```zig
pub fn try_receive(self: *Mbox, slot: *Slot) error{Closed}!bool
```
- Non-blocking.
- Returns true if handle received, false if queue empty.
- The Slot must be empty.

```zig
pub fn receive_batch(self: *Mbox) error{Closed}!polynode.ItemList
```
- Non-blocking.
- Takes everything from the queue at once.
- Returns an empty `ItemList` if queue is currently empty.
- Does not wait. Does not return error for empty.
- The caller has every item in the list — same duty as after `close()`.

### Control

```zig
pub fn wakeUpAll(self: *Mbox) error{Closed}!void
```
- Wakes every receiver currently blocked in `receive()` — no item is sent, nothing is queued.
- Blocked receivers return `error.Wakeup`.
- Future receivers (those that call `receive()` after `wakeUpAll()` returns) are not affected.
- Distinct from `close()`: the mailbox is not torn down, and the effect does not persist for
  receivers that start later.

```zig
pub fn close(self: *Mbox) polynode.ItemList
```
- Can be called more than once.
- Returns remaining handles as list (empty list on second call).
- Collects all handles still in the queue.
- Wakes up any receivers waiting on the mailbox.
- The caller has every item in the returned list, and must release them —
  free them, or put them back into a pool.

Run the release unconditionally:

```zig
var rem: polynode.ItemList = mbx.close();
// release every item in `rem`
```

`close` can be called more than once, and an empty list costs nothing, so no call site has to  
work out whether the mailbox was emptied first. Never write  
`_ = mbx.close()` — it drops items the mailbox gave back, and those items  
keep their list links, so `send` will reject them.

### Error sets

| Error | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `error.Closed` | Mailbox was closed via `close()` |
| `error.Timeout` | `timeout_ns` expired (only when non-null) |
| `error.Canceled` | Waiting operation was canceled |
| `error.Wakeup` | `wakeUpAll()` woke this receiver — no item, mailbox stays open |

### Event source

Mailbox as event source for `Io.Select` and `Io.Future`.

Cancel and close in concurrent tasks:

- Mailbox closed — blocked receivers wake with `error.Closed`.
- Task canceled — the operation returns `error.Canceled`.

```zig
// nested in Mbox
pub const Result = union(enum) {
    item: ItemHandle,
    closed: void,
    timeout: void,
    canceled: void,
    wakeup: void,
};
```

- The handle is inside the result, not behind a pointer. No `*Slot` is shared across threads.
- When you get `.item`, the handle is yours. The mailbox no longer has it.

```zig
pub fn receiveResult(mbx: *Mbox, timeout_ns: ?u64) Mbox.Result
```
- Blocking function. No error return — maps all outcomes to `Mbox.Result` variants.
- Primary building block for Select integration:
  ```zig
  try select.concurrent(.inbox, mailbox.receiveResult, .{mbx, null});
  ```
- Also usable with `io.concurrent` or `group.concurrent`.

```zig
pub fn receive_future(self: *Mbox, timeout_ns: ?u64) ConcurrentError!Io.Future(Mbox.Result)
```
- Thin wrapper: `return mbx.*.io.concurrent(receiveResult, .{mbx, timeout_ns})`.
- No heap allocation — args copied by the runtime before `concurrent` returns.
- Returns a Future for direct await or `Io.Group` use.
- Returns `error.ConcurrencyUnavailable` on single-threaded backends.

Cancel behavior.

- On `error.Canceled`, returns `.canceled` — the mailbox remains open.
- Closing is the Master's responsibility.

**`select.concurrent` pattern** (primary):  
```zig
try select.concurrent(.inbox, mailbox.receiveResult, .{mbx, null});
const event = try select.await();
switch (event) {
    .inbox => |r| switch (r) { ... },
    ...
}
```

**`receive_future` pattern** (direct await or Group):  
```zig
const fut = try mbx.receive_future(null);
const result = try fut.await(io);
```

**Bridging to external Io**: one `Io.Select` loop combines mailbox, timers, sockets, pool availability.

- Matryoshka sources use `receiveResult` / `getWaitResult` via `select.concurrent`.
- External sources use their own blocking functions via `select.concurrent`.
- Direct push: `select.queue.putOneUncancelable(io, value)` for immediate events.

## Part 5 — pool

---


### What this is

Reuse of items, decided by user supplied hooks.

Pool is not storage.

- It answers one question: is a reusable item available right now.
- It signals backpressure through that answer.
- What happens to an item on `put` is entirely up to the hooks.

The pool touches items — through your hooks. It creates, resets, keeps or  
destroys, but every one of those is a hook doing it, never the pool deciding.  
This is the difference from `mailbox`, which never touches an item at all.

A closed pool gives items back:

- `put` is a no-op and leaves the slot unchanged.
- `put_all` stops at the first refusal and leaves the rest in the list.

Either way the caller still has those items and must release them. Check  
the slot after `put`, and check the list after `put_all`.

`close` is the other difference. It collects everything it keeps and passes the  
list to `on_close`, so the hook releases it — where a mailbox returns the  
list to the caller and leaves the releasing to them.

The pool does not care whether you closed it, except `destroy`, which panics  
on an open pool.

### Participants

```zig
const pool = @import("matryoshka").pool;

pub const Pool = struct { ... };

pub const GetMode = enum {
    available_or_new,    // use stored handle if available, otherwise call on_get to create
    new_only,            // always call on_get with slot.* == null to create fresh
    available_only,      // use stored handle only; if empty, return error.NotAvailable
};

pub const GetError = error{
    Closed,
    NotAvailable,
    NotCreated,
};
```

- `Pool` — the pool. Application code holds `*Pool` and calls methods on it.
  The struct fields are internal.
- `Pool.Hooks` — your policy. Three functions and a context. The Hooks section
  at the end of this part describes them.
- `Slot` — from polynode. Every get and every put goes through one.
- `ItemList` — from polynode. What `put_all` takes, and what `on_put` and
  `on_close` carry.

A pool is also a PolyNode — `toPoly`/`fromPoly` cross the border. A pool  
can be:

- sent through a mailbox
- embedded into larger structures

Same rules as application items.

### Usual flow

Four steps. Two set up, two take down. The same four as a mailbox.

- The hooks go in at step 1.
- A pool cannot exist without them.

```zig
var pl_slot: Slot = null;                          // 1. create
try pool.new(io, alloc, my_hooks, &pl_slot);
const pl: *Pool = Pool.moveFromSlot(&pl_slot).?;
defer pool.destroy(pl, alloc);                     // 4. free the pool itself

// 2. use it
try pl.get(EVENT_TAG, .available_or_new, &slot);
pl.put(&slot);

pl.close();                                        // 3. on_close releases what is left
```

1. **Create.**
   - `pool.new(io, alloc, hooks, &slot)` fills a Slot. It returns no pointer.
   - The Slot must be empty on entry. `new` asserts it.
   - On failure the Slot is left unchanged.
   - `Pool.moveFromSlot(&slot)` takes the pointer out and empties the Slot.
     - Call it on the next line.
     - Nothing fallible belongs between the two.
     - This step is called **detaching**, the same as for a mailbox. Part 4
       says why the word and the call differ.
   - The Slot is a local. It dies where it was declared.
   - The hooks are the pool.
     - `on_get` creates.
     - `on_put` decides whether an item is kept.
     - `on_close` releases.
   - A pool is one call. There is no second step that arms it.
   - The tag list must not be empty.
2. **Use.**
   - `get` asks whether a reusable item is available right now.
   - `put` offers one back.
   - Check the slot after `put`.
     - A refusal leaves it non-null.
     - You still have the item.
3. **Close.**
   - `close` collects everything the pool keeps.
   - It passes the list to `on_close`.
   - Nothing comes back to you.
   - After `close`:
     - `put` is a no-op.
     - Your slot is left unchanged.
4. **Destroy.**
   - `pool.destroy(pl, alloc)` frees the pool itself.
   - `pool.destroy_slot(&slot, alloc)` does the same from a Slot, and empties
     it.

Close before destroy.

- Always.
- `destroy` panics on an open pool.

`destroy` is not optional.

- `on_close` releases the items.
- The pool struct is a separate allocation.
- Only `destroy` frees it.

Teardown is the sharpest difference between the two.

- A pool passes its items to `on_close`.
- A mailbox returns them to the caller.

The four steps in real code:

```zig
var pl_slot: Slot = null;
try pool.new(io, allocator, ctx.poolHooks(&tags), &pl_slot);
const pl: *Pool = Pool.moveFromSlot(&pl_slot).?;
defer {
    pl.close();
    pool.destroy(pl, allocator);
}

var slot: Slot = null;
defer pl.put(&slot);

try pl.get(items.Event.EventPolyHelper.TAG, .available_or_new, &slot);
const ev = items.Event.EventPolyHelper.fromSlot(&slot) orelse return error.WrongTag;
ev.code = 89;

pl.put(&slot);
```

Source: `examples/layer3/089-basic_recycler.zig`.

What an item does between the steps:

```text
new(io, alloc, hooks, &slot)
  ↓ moveFromSlot
EMPTY pool

get() [available_or_new, pool empty]     get() [available_or_new, pool has items]
  ↓ on_get creates item                    ↓ item moved from free-list
IN_FLIGHT (with caller)                  IN_FLIGHT (with caller)

put() [on_put keeps]      put() [on_put destroys]
  ↓                         ↓
HELD (pool free-list)     FREE (caller frees)

get() [available_only or available_or_new]
  ↓
IN_FLIGHT (with caller)

close()
  ↓ on_close receives full list of HELD items → caller frees each
FREE
  ↓ destroy(pl, alloc)
the pool itself is freed
```

### Create and destroy

```zig
pub fn new(io: Io, alloc: std.mem.Allocator, hooks: Pool.Hooks, slot: *polynode.Slot) !void
```
- Creates a pool and puts it in the Slot.
- The Slot must be empty on entry.
- The Slot is left unchanged if the creation fails.
- The hooks are registered here. There is no second call.
- The tag list must not be empty.
- Stores `io` internally.

Hooks are the three functions the pool calls on your behalf — `on_get`,  
`on_put` and `on_close` — plus the tags they answer for. Without them the pool  
has no policy and cannot make an item, which is why they are a parameter of  
`new` rather than a step after it. The **Hooks** section at the end of this  
part says what each one does, and what must not happen inside one.

```zig
pub fn destroy(pl: *Pool, alloc: std.mem.Allocator) void
```
- Frees the pool.
- Must be closed first.
- Calling destroy on an open pool is a programming error (panic).

```zig
pub fn destroy_slot(slot: *polynode.Slot, alloc: std.mem.Allocator) void
```
- Frees the pool in the Slot, and empties the Slot.
- An empty Slot is a no-op. So is a second call on the same Slot.
- A Slot holding another type is a programming error (panic).
- Must be closed first, as `destroy` requires.

```zig
pub fn is_it_you(tag: *const anyopaque) bool
```
- Returns true if tag identifies a *Pool.

### Get

```zig
pub fn get(self: *Pool, tag: *const anyopaque, mode: GetMode, slot: *Slot) GetError!void
```
- Non-blocking acquisition.
- Calls `on_get` hook.
- Moves the handle — `slot.*` set to non-null on success.
- The Slot must be empty, and the tag one the pool answers for.

```zig
pub fn get_wait(self: *Pool, tag: *const anyopaque, slot: *Slot, timeout_ns: ?u64) (GetError || Cancelable || error{Timeout})!void
```
- Blocking acquisition.
- `null` timeout = wait forever.
- `timeout_ns = 0` returns `error.Timeout` immediately.
- Logically equivalent to `get(.available_only)`, but a different error (`error.Timeout` vs `error.NotAvailable`).
- Intentional: `get_wait` always uses the timeout error set, regardless of the timeout value.
- Calls `on_get` hook.
- Same three preconditions as `get`.

### Put

```zig
pub fn put(self: *Pool, slot: *Slot) void
```
- Returns handle to pool.
- `slot.* == null` → returns immediately. No hook call. No assert on tag.
- **Open pool**:
  - Calls `on_put` hook.
  - `on_put` picks the outcome — matryoshka does not mandate any of them:
    - **deleted, nothing returned** — hook frees the item, `slot.*` set to null, nothing added to the pool.
    - **returned as-is** — hook leaves the item's data untouched, `slot.*` stays non-null, pool keeps it.
    - **returned after reset** — hook resets the item's data before keeping it, `slot.*` stays non-null.
    - **deleted, a different item returned** — hook frees the original and puts a different item in `slot.*`.
  - `slot.*` stays non-null exactly when an item — original or replacement — is kept in the pool; it's null when nothing is kept.
  - `on_put` also returns `?ItemList` — items to add alongside
    `slot`. `null` or empty: nothing extra. Non-empty: each item is added  
    the same way `slot`'s item is — same checks, same assert on foreign  
    tag. See Composite items below.
- **Closed pool**:
  - Returns immediately, no hook call.
  - `slot.*` stays non-null — the caller keeps the handle.
- An item being put must not be in a list.

**No sequence guarantee.**

- The outcome of `put` is entirely hook-policy-driven.
- A call pattern like "put three times, then get three times" carries no fixed count, identity, or ordering guarantee.
- What comes back — how many items, in what state, whether they're the same items that were put — depends on the hooks, not on the shape of the call sequence.
- This repo's own example hooks (`examples/hooks/`) follow one specific convention: reset to default values on `put`.
- That convention is our examples' choice, not a rule matryoshka imposes.

```zig
pub fn put_all(self: *Pool, list: *polynode.ItemList) void
```
- Returns batch of handles to pool.
- Pops from caller's list.
- Transfer is not atomic with respect to `close()`.
- If the pool closes mid-batch: items already transferred are passed to `on_close`; items not yet transferred stay in the caller's list.
- Restoration order when closed mid-batch may differ from original order.
- Every tag in the list must be one the pool answers for.

**Composite items.**

An item may keep other pooled items.

Before the parent item enters the pool, `on_put` can return them as an  
extra `ItemList` alongside `slot`. The pool adds every item in  
that list the same way it adds `slot`'s item.

The hook is responsible for giving back only valid, unlinked,  
correctly-tagged items — the pool does not validate that they form a  
real composite.

The pool does not distinguish between simple and composite items.

### Control

```zig
pub fn close(self: *Pool) void
```
- Can be called more than once.
- Collects all handles from all per-tag free-lists.
- Calls `on_close` once with the full list.
- Broadcasts to wake blocked `get_wait` callers.

### Error sets

| Error | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `error.Closed` | Pool was closed via `close()` |
| `error.NotAvailable` | `available_only` mode, no stored handle |
| `error.NotCreated` | `on_get` was called but did not return a handle |
| `error.Timeout` | `timeout_ns` expired (only when non-null, `get_wait` only) |
| `error.Canceled` | Waiting operation was canceled (`get_wait` only) |

### Event source

Pool as event source for `Io.Select` and `Io.Future`.

Cancel and close in concurrent tasks:

- Pool closed — blocked callers wake with `error.Closed`.
- Task canceled — the operation returns `error.Canceled`.

When a handle becomes available, the Master can react. This is the job-pool pattern:

- Worker returns a handle.
- Master is notified.
- Master submits new work.

```zig
// nested in Pool
pub const Result = union(enum) {
    item: ItemHandle,
    closed: void,
    timeout: void,
    canceled: void,
    not_created: void,
};
```

- The handle is inside the result, not behind a pointer. No `*Slot` is shared across threads.
- When you get `.item`, the handle is yours. The pool no longer keeps it.
- Re-spawn the event source after handling each result.

```zig
pub fn getWaitResult(pl: *Pool, tag: *const anyopaque, timeout_ns: ?u64) Pool.Result
```
- Blocking function. No error return — maps all outcomes to `Pool.Result` variants.
- Primary building block for Select integration:
  ```zig
  try select.concurrent(.pool, pool.getWaitResult, .{pl, TAG, null});
  ```
- Also usable with `io.concurrent` or `group.concurrent`.

```zig
pub fn get_wait_future(self: *Pool, tag: *const anyopaque, timeout_ns: ?u64) ConcurrentError!Io.Future(Pool.Result)
```
- Thin wrapper: `return p.*.io.concurrent(getWaitResult, .{pl, tag, timeout_ns})`.
- No heap allocation — args copied by the runtime before `concurrent` returns.
- Returns a Future for direct await or `Io.Group` use.
- Returns `error.ConcurrencyUnavailable` on single-threaded backends.

Cancel behavior.

- On `error.Canceled`, returns `.canceled` — the pool remains open.
- Closing is the Master's responsibility.

### Hooks

The hooks are the pool's policy. You implement them; the pool calls them.

This section comes last in the part, and here is the reason.

- `get` and `put` are what you call.
- Hooks are what you write.
- A first-pass reader needs the first.
- A hook writer arrives on a second visit, when `get` and `put` already mean
  something.

```zig
// nested in Pool
pub const Hooks = struct {
    ctx:      *anyopaque,
    tags:     []const *const anyopaque,
    on_get:   *const fn (ctx: *anyopaque, tag: *const anyopaque, in_pool_count: usize, slot: *Slot) void,
    on_put:   *const fn (ctx: *anyopaque, in_pool_count: usize, slot: *Slot) ?polynode.ItemList,
    on_close: *const fn (ctx: *anyopaque, list: *polynode.ItemList) void,
};
```

- `ctx` — your state. The pool passes it back and never reads it.
- `tags` — every tag this pool answers for. A `get` or `put` with another tag
  is a programming error.

#### `on_get` — create or reinitialize

- Called for every `get` and `get_wait` call regardless of mode or whether an
  item was found in the free-list.
- If `slot.*` is non-null on entry: the item was recycled from the free-list —
  reinitialize it.
- If `slot.*` is null on entry: no item was available — create a new one or
  leave null (creation failed).
- Must either leave `slot.* == null` (creation failed) OR set `slot.*` to a
  valid node with the tag that was requested. Another tag is a programming  
  error.

#### `on_put` — keep or destroy

- Set `slot.*` to null = destroy.
- Leave non-null = keep in pool.
- Return value: `?ItemList` of extra items. `null`/empty = nothing extra.
  Non-empty = each item added like `slot`'s. See Composite items above.

#### `on_close` — release everything left

- Receives `*ItemList`.
- Walks via `popFirst()`, frees each handle.
- The pool calls it once, with the full list.

#### `in_pool_count`

- `on_get`: count **after** removal — items remaining with this tag.
- `on_put`: count **before** addition — items already stored with this tag.
- Both are **hints**. The pool may have changed by the time your hook reads
  them. Use them to shape policy, never as a count you rely on.

#### Concurrency, and what a hook may not do

- Hooks run outside the pool's internal lock, so your hook does not block other
  pool operations.
- Several hooks may run at once, on different threads. The pool does not
  serialize them.

If your hook touches shared state, protect it.

- Use `Io.Mutex` and call `lockUncancelable` to acquire it. Hooks return
  `void` — `lock` (cancelable) is not an option here.
- Obtain `io` from the surrounding context that has the pool; do not acquire it
  inside the hook.

From inside a hook, never call back into the same pool, never block, and never  
wait. This is a contract, not a deadlock warning.

## Part 6 — Using them together

The material below spans the three tools. No section of it belongs to one part  
alone.

Four sections:

- **Identity across the tools** — when a tag is not enough to tell two items
  apart.
- **The slot rule** — and the cleanup patterns that follow from it.
- **Concurrency and cancel** — what other threads may call, and what a cancelled
  operation leaves behind.
- **What the toolkit assumes** — invariants, contract violations, layer
  dependencies.

Each section stands on its own. Read the one you need.

### Identity across the tools

A tag says what an item is. It never says which one.

#### Tag identity — class, not instance

`PolyHelper(T)` generates one static `_tag: PolyTag` per type `T` at comptime.  
`TAG` is a pointer to that static — the same address for every instance of `T`.

Tag dispatch (`is_it_you`, `isIt`, `fromPoly`) answers one question: **"is this a T?"**  
It does not answer: "which T?" or "what role does this T play?"

For user-defined types (Event, Sensor, etc.):
- Tag identifies the class.
- Instance fields carry the role. The user adds a `kind` or `role` field to discriminate.

For infra handles (*Mbox, *Pool):
- `_Mailbox` and `_Pool` are private structs. The user cannot add fields.
- Tag identifies the class only. No per-instance role information is accessible.
- **Instance identity**: resolved by pointer comparison against known handles.
  E.g. `received == worker_mbx` identifies which specific mailbox arrived.
- **Role**: established by protocol — the channel the handle arrived on, message
  ordering, or prior agreement between sender and receiver.

##### Transporting infra handles — valid patterns

**Worker-finish-signal pattern**

Master creates `worker_mbx`, spawns a worker via `io.concurrent` and passes `worker_mbx` as parameter.  
Worker processes items until a shutdown signal, then:
- Sends `worker_mbx` back to master's inbox (unclosed) as the finish signal.
- Exits.

Master receives a PolyNode from its inbox:
- `mailbox.is_it_you(received.*.tag)` — confirms class (it is a mailbox).
- `received == worker_mbx` — confirms instance (it is the expected worker mailbox).
- Master closes and destroys `worker_mbx`.
- Master awaits the worker's future (cleanup only — the mailbox return was the logical finish signal).

This pattern replaces relying on the future await as a completion signal, or a separate shutdown message, with a handle handoff.

**Wrapper pattern** (for tag-level role discrimination)

When tag dispatch must distinguish roles, wrap the handle in a user-defined PolyNode struct:

```zig
const WorkerInbox = struct {
    poly: PolyNode,
    handle: *Mbox,
};
pub const WorkerInboxPolyHelper = polynode.PolyHelper(WorkerInbox);
```

`WorkerInboxPolyHelper.TAG` is distinct from `Mbox.TAG`.  
The receiver dispatches on `WorkerInboxPolyHelper.TAG` and finds the embedded handle.

---

### The slot rule

One slot, one item. Everything about cleanup follows from that.

#### Slot-based programming

The slot rule governs every acquisition and transfer.

The slot rule:
- Never overwrite a non-null slot.
- Always start with `var slot: Slot = null`.
- All acquisition APIs assert `slot.* == null` on entry. Writing to a non-null slot panics.
- Transfer clears the slot: sender sets `slot.* = null`. After transfer, slot is null.
- Applies universally: pool get/put, mailbox receive, heap allocation — every combination.

**Exception — event-source helpers**:

- `receiveResult` and `getWaitResult` do not take a `*Slot` parameter.
- They move the handle via the returned union value (`Mbox.Result.item`, `Pool.Result.item`) instead.
- The caller extracts the handle from the union and holds it from that point.
- This is an intentional exception to the slot-pointer pattern.

##### Why acquisition APIs assert null

Every acquisition API has this check:

```zig
std.debug.assert(slot.* == null);
```

Overwriting a non-null slot would lose the previous item with no error signal.  
The assert catches this immediately.

##### Why cleanup operations accept null

`Pool.put` and `PolyHelper.destroy` check null and return early:

```zig
if (slot.* == null) return;
```

This makes defer-before-acquisition safe.

##### Slot states

```text
Slot states

  null ──── acquire ────► non-null
    ▲                        │
    │                        │
    ├──── transfer ──────────┘   (sender clears: slot.* = null)
    │
    └──── cleanup (no-op) ──────  (Pool.put, PolyHelper.destroy: null → return)
```

##### Moving a handle clears the slot

```text
Before transfer                  After transfer

  Slot (sender)                    Slot (sender)
  ┌─────────────┐                  ┌─────────────┐
  │ ItemHandle  │                  │    null     │
  └─────────────┘                  └─────────────┘
                                           │
  mbx.send(&slot)                    │ slot.* = null
                                           │
                     Mailbox ◄─────────────┘
                     now holds ItemHandle
```

##### Defer-before-acquisition is safe

```text
Code order:                      Execution when acquire fails:

  var slot: Slot = null;              slot = null
  defer pl.put(&slot);          acquire fails
  try pool.get(..., &slot);           defer runs: Pool.put sees null → no-op
  // work                          ✓ nothing lost

                                 Execution when item is transferred:

                                   slot = null (after acquire: slot is non-null)
                                   mbx.send(&slot)  → slot = null
                                   defer runs: Pool.put sees null → no-op
                                   ✓ item transferred, not double-recycled
```

---

#### Item states

```
FREE       — allocated, not in any system
IN_FLIGHT  — with user code (Slot non-null)
HELD       — with infrastructure (in mailbox queue or pool free-list)
```

| Operation | Before → After |
|-----------|---------------|
| `Mbox.send` | IN_FLIGHT → HELD |
| `Mbox.receive` | HELD → IN_FLIGHT |
| `Pool.get` | HELD → IN_FLIGHT |
| `Pool.put` (keep) | IN_FLIGHT → HELD |
| `Pool.put` (destroy) | IN_FLIGHT → FREE |
| `Mbox.close` | HELD → returned to caller |
| `Pool.close` | HELD → passed to on_close |

---

#### Cooperative cleanup patterns

These patterns follow from the slot rule.  
Place cleanup before acquisition.  
The defer becomes a no-op when the slot is null — either because acquisition failed, or because the item was transferred.

##### Pattern 1 — defer-put-early (pool item)

```zig
var slot: Slot = null;
defer pl.put(&slot);              // no-op if slot == null
try pl.get(TAG, .new_only, &slot);
// ... work ...
// on transfer: slot = null → defer runs as no-op
// on no transfer: defer recycles item
```

Put before get — safe because Pool.put is a no-op on null.

If the pool may be closed while the item is held, Pool.put leaves slot non-null (caller retains  
held). Add a fallback destroy to avoid a leak:

```zig
var slot: Slot = null;
defer EventPolyHelper.destroy(alloc, &slot); // fallback: frees if Pool.put left slot non-null
defer pl.put(&slot);                   // primary: recycles to pool (clears slot on success)
// defers run LIFO: Pool.put first, then destroy (no-op if Pool.put cleared slot)
```

##### Pattern 2 — defer-destroy-early (heap item via PolyHelper)

```zig
var slot: Slot = null;
defer EventPolyHelper.destroy(allocator, &slot);   // no-op if slot == null
try EventPolyHelper.create(allocator, &slot);
// ... work ...
// on transfer: slot = null → defer runs as no-op
// on no transfer: defer frees item
```

Destroy before create — safe because PolyHelper.destroy is a no-op on null.

##### Pattern 3 — defer for received mailbox item

```zig
var slot: Slot = null;
defer if (slot) |poly| helpers.freeItem(poly, allocator);
try mbx.receive(&slot, null);
// dispatch on slot.?.*.tag, process item
// item stays non-null until explicitly transferred or freed
```

Cleanup covers both the error path (receive failed) and the normal path (item processed and freed).

##### Pattern 4 — transfer clears the slot

```zig
var slot: Slot = null;
defer pl.put(&slot);
try pl.get(TAG, .new_only, &slot);
// fill item ...
try mbx.send(&slot);   // send sets slot.* = null
// defer runs: Pool.put sees null → no-op
// result: item is in mailbox, not recycled to pool
```

Transfer and cleanup are not in conflict — transfer pre-empts cleanup by clearing the slot.

##### Pattern summary

```text
Pattern 1 (pool item)            Pattern 2 (heap item)

  null ──► get ──► non-null        null ──► create ──► non-null
    ▲                │               ▲                   │
    │    put (defer) │               │  destroy (defer)  │
    └────────────────┘               └───────────────────┘
         (recycle)                          (free)

         transfer →                         transfer →
         slot = null                           slot = null
         defer: no-op                       defer: no-op
```

##### No raw allocator calls on PolyNode-based types

In examples and tests, never use `allocator.create` / `allocator.destroy` directly on  
PolyNode-based user types (Event, Sensor, Timer, ShutdownCommand).

Use `PolyHelper.create`, `PolyHelper.destroy`, or `helpers.freeSlot` instead.

###### Violation

```zig
// WRONG — raw allocator on PolyNode-based type
const ev = try alloc.create(Event);
ev.* = .{};
EventPolyHelper.init(ev);
slot.* = &ev.poly;
// ... later ...
alloc.destroy(EventPolyHelper.mustFromSlot(&slot));
slot.* = null;
```

###### Correct

```zig
// CORRECT — PolyHelper.create/destroy
var slot: Slot = null;
defer EventPolyHelper.destroy(alloc, &slot);
try EventPolyHelper.create(alloc, &slot);
// ... dispatch: use helpers.freeSlot(&slot, alloc) per branch ...
```

###### Exempt

- `mailbox.zig`, `pool.zig` — allocating/freeing their own internal structs.
- `PolyHelper.create` / `PolyHelper.destroy` implementations.
- Pool hook bodies (`on_get`, `on_close`) — manage raw memory on behalf of pool.
- Non-PolyNode structs: worker context, hook context, allocator wrappers.

### Concurrency and cancel

What is safe to call from another thread, and what a cancelled call leaves you holding.

#### Thread-safety contract

| Function | Concurrent callers | Notes |
|----------|--------------------|-------|
| `Mbox.send` | yes | Multiple senders safe |
| `Mbox.send_oob` | yes | Multiple senders safe |
| `Mbox.receive` | yes | One handle per waiter; scheduling order is runtime-dependent |
| `Mbox.try_receive` | yes | |
| `Mbox.receive_batch` | yes | Transfers whole queue atomically |
| `Mbox.close` | yes — once | Second call returns empty list |
| `mailbox.destroy` | no | Must happen after all users have stopped |
| `Pool.get` | yes | |
| `Pool.get_wait` | yes | One handle per waiter; scheduling order is runtime-dependent |
| `Pool.put` | yes | |
| `Pool.put_all` | yes | Thread-safe per item; batch is NOT atomic wrt close() — items transferred before close go to on_close; items not yet transferred stay in caller's list |
| `Pool.close` | yes — once | Second call is a no-op |
| `pool.destroy` | no | Must happen after all users have stopped |

#### Cancel model

Only functions that wait on a condition can be canceled.  
Everything else runs to completion.

- A waiting function blocks until a handle becomes available or a timeout expires.
- While waiting, the runtime can cancel the operation. The function returns `error.Canceled`.
- All other functions do their work and return. They cannot be canceled.

A function is cancelable if and only if its return type includes `Cancelable` in the error union.  
The signature is the single source of truth.

#### Cancel contract summary

| Function | Cancelable | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| `Mbox.send` | no | non-blocking |
| `Mbox.send_oob` | no | non-blocking |
| `Mbox.receive` | **yes** | waits for a handle |
| `Mbox.try_receive` | no | non-blocking |
| `Mbox.receive_batch` | no | non-blocking |
| `Mbox.close` | no | non-blocking |
| `Pool.get` | no | non-blocking |
| `Pool.get_wait` | **yes** | waits for a handle |
| `Pool.put` | no | non-blocking |
| `Pool.put_all` | no | non-blocking |
| `Pool.close` | no | non-blocking |
| `mailbox.receiveResult` | **yes** | blocking; cancelable via task cancel |
| `Mbox.receive_future` | **yes** | thin wrapper around `io.concurrent(receiveResult, ...)` |
| `pool.getWaitResult` | **yes** | blocking; cancelable via task cancel |
| `Pool.get_wait_future` | **yes** | thin wrapper around `io.concurrent(getWaitResult, ...)` |

---

#### What cancellation leaves behind

When a cancellable operation returns `error.Canceled`:

- `Mbox.receive`: slot is unchanged — `slot.*` was `null` on entry and remains `null`. The mailbox retains any queued items.
- `Pool.get_wait`: slot is unchanged — `slot.*` was `null` on entry and remains `null`. The pool retains all free-list items.

Cancellation never closes the mailbox or pool. Closing is the caller's responsibility.

---

### What the toolkit assumes

The conditions the toolkit holds true, and what happens when they do not.

#### Invariants

These hold at all times, for every node in the system:

- A linked node belongs to exactly one container (mailbox queue or pool free-list). Never two at once.
- A Slot holds exactly one node. A null Slot holds nothing.
- A pool never holds a linked node — items in its free-lists are unlinked relative to other pools.
- A mailbox never holds a free node — only nodes currently in its queue.
- Every node is in exactly one place at all times: either with user code (via Slot) or with infrastructure (in queue or free-list). Never both.
- Tag identity is determined by pointer address alone. Never compare tag contents or names — compare only `==` on the pointer value.

---

#### Contract violations

Programming errors.  
Checked via `std.debug.assert`:
- Active in Debug and ReleaseSafe.
- Removed in ReleaseFast and ReleaseSmall.

- **Wrong handle type** — passing a *Pool where *Mbox is expected, or vice versa.
  - Checked via `is_it_you` on every API call.
- **Non-empty slot on receive/get** — slot must be null before receiving or getting a handle.
- **Linked node on send/put** — node must not be linked into a list before transfer.
- **Foreign tag** — pool operation with a tag not registered in the pool's tag set.
- **Uninitialized pool** — calling get/get_wait before init.
- **Double insertion** — pushing a linked node into a list.
- **Corrupted or invalid tag** — tag does not match any known type.

The following are unconditional panics (all build modes):

- **Destroying an open mailbox or pool** — must close first.
- **Use after free** — using a node after its memory was freed.

---

#### Layer dependencies

```
             Layer 4
             Master
                |
      +---------+---------+
      |                   |
   Layer 2            Layer 3
   Mailbox              Pool
      |                   |
      +---------+---------+
                |
            Layer 1
          Type identity
```

Dependencies:
- Mailbox and Pool are independent — neither depends on the other.
- Both depend only on the one-place-one-state model.
- Master is where they are combined.

Valid combinations:
- Layer 1 only — type identity without infrastructure
- Layer 1 + Layer 2 — type identity + message passing, no item reuse
- Layer 1 + Layer 3 — type identity + item reuse, no message passing
- Layer 1 + Layer 2 + Layer 3 + Io — full stack (Master)

---

## Part 7 — Beyond the toolkit

Three things outside the three tools.

- The root module — what an import gives you.
- Master — the coordination role, and why it is not a type.
- The Io backend, and how Matryoshka plugs into `Io.Select`.

### The matryoshka root module

One import gives the three tools.

```zig
const matryoshka = @import("matryoshka");
```

What it re-exports:

```zig
pub const polynode = @import("polynode.zig");
pub const mailbox = @import("mailbox.zig");
pub const pool = @import("pool.zig");
```

Two aliases come with them, for the types application code holds.

```zig
pub const Mbox = mailbox.Mbox;
pub const Pool = pool.Pool;
```

- `matryoshka.Mbox` and `mailbox.Mbox` are the same type.
- Import whichever reads better at the call site.

### Master — intentionally not part of the API

No `master` module.  
No `Master` struct.  
By design.

Io creates tasks through `io.concurrent()`.  
Master is an Io task that follows the Matryoshka rules — the coordination boundary.  
It holds and composes the lower layers.

Applications build Masters from:

| What | Where it comes from |
|------|-------------------|
| Transport | `*Mbox` — one or more mailboxes |
| Item reuse | `*Pool` + `Pool.Hooks` — reuse and policy |
| Memory | `std.mem.Allocator` — who allocates and frees |
| Scheduling | `std.Io` — passed to `mailbox.new` and `pool.new` |
| Worker coordination | `io.concurrent()` → `Future`, or `Io.Group` |
| Cancellation | `Future.cancel(io)` or `group.cancel(io)` |
| Application state | Domain-specific — whatever the subsystem needs |

Both mailbox and pool are optional. Valid combinations:

```text
PolyNode only                        type identity without infrastructure
PolyNode + Mailbox                   type identity + message passing
PolyNode + Pool                      type identity + item reuse
PolyNode + Pool + Io.Select          item reuse + event sources (no mailbox)
PolyNode + Mailbox + Pool            transport + item reuse
PolyNode + Mailbox + Pool + Io.Select   full stack
```

A Master may be:  
```zig
const Server = struct { inbox: *Mbox, pool: *Pool, ... };
const Scheduler = struct { pool: *Pool, ... };  // no mailbox
const Pipeline = struct { stages: [3]*Mbox, ... };
fn main(init: std.process.Init) !void { ... }
```

Matryoshka provides the tools.  
The application assembles them.

### Io backend for Layer 4 tests and examples

Layer 1-3 tests use `std.Io.Threaded.global_single_threaded.*.io()` — no concurrency needed.

Layer 4 tests and examples need real concurrency (`io.concurrent`, `Io.Group`):
- Use `std.Io.Threaded.init(allocator, .{})` to get a real backend.
- Call `.deinit()` when done.

```zig
// In a Layer 4 test:
var threaded = try std.Io.Threaded.init(std.testing.allocator, .{});
defer threaded.deinit();
const io: std.Io = threaded.io();
```

```zig
// In a Layer 4 example (run function):
pub fn run(allocator: std.mem.Allocator, io: std.Io) !void {
    // io is passed in — examples never create the backend themselves
}
```

```zig
// In the test wrapper for a Layer 4 example:
test "17 - minimal master" {
    std.testing.log_level = .debug;
    var threaded = try std.Io.Threaded.init(std.testing.allocator, .{});
    defer threaded.deinit();
    const io: std.Io = threaded.io();
    try layer4.minimal_master.run(std.testing.allocator, io);
}
```

Key rules:
- `std.testing.io` — not used in this project, even in test files.
- `global_single_threaded` — Layer 1-3 only. Returns `error.ConcurrencyUnavailable` for `io.concurrent`.
- `Io.Threaded.init` — Layer 4 tests and example wrappers.
- Examples receive `std.Io` as a parameter. They never import or reference `std.testing`.

### Event sources

See [Io 101](https://g41797.github.io/matryoshka-ztk/addendums/io-101/) for the general `Future` → `Io.Select` pattern.

Matryoshka plugs into the same pattern:

```text
  mailbox.receiveResult ──► select.concurrent(.inbox, ...)  ──┐
  pool.getWaitResult    ──► select.concurrent(.pool, ...)   ──┼──► Io.Select.queue ──► Master dispatch
  Io.sleep              ──► select.concurrent(.timer, ...)  ──┤
  direct push           ──► select.queue.putOneUncancelable ──┘
```

- `mailbox.receiveResult` + `select.concurrent` — mailbox as Select event source.
- `pool.getWaitResult` + `select.concurrent` — pool as Select event source.
- `Mbox.receive_future` / `Pool.get_wait_future` — Future wrappers for direct await or `Io.Group`.
- Master calls `select.await()`, handles the result, re-spawns the source.

## Change log

API 13 : Rewrite reference , update src comments

API 12 (real pointers): `MailboxHandle` and `PoolHandle` are gone. `Mbox`  
and `Pool` are public structs with internal fields; application code holds  
`*Mbox` / `*Pool` and calls methods on the pointer. Companion types nest —  
`Mbox.Result`, `Pool.Result`, `Pool.Hooks`, `Pool.GetMode`, `Pool.GetError`.  
`new`, `destroy`, `receiveResult`, `getWaitResult` and `is_it_you` stay  
free functions on the module. Both types remain PolyNodes: `toPoly` in,  
`fromPoly` / `mustFromPoly` out.

API 11 (accessor rename): `fromNode`, `mustFromNode` and `toNode` become `fromPoly`, `mustFromPoly` and `toPoly`. `PolyNode` embeds `node: std.DoublyLinkedList.Node`, so "node" named two things at once, and the field the helper reaches is `poly`. Hard rename, no aliases. The Slot accessors keep their names.

API 10 (ItemList completion): `remove`, `popLast`, `first`, `last` and `insertBefore` added. `iterate` renamed to `iterator`, the std name — breaking, no shim. `concat` returns early on the same list twice, because its assert is `unreachable` outside safety builds and `concatByMoving` would ring the items and clear the header. Every insert now also asserts `!is_linked` on the new item, which sees a different list where the container walk cannot. `moveFromList` asserts the std header it is handed is consistent. `std.DoublyLinkedList` checks nothing; `ItemList` is where it is checked.

API 9 (intrusive safety): `ItemList.appendFromSlot` and `ItemList.prependFromSlot` added — they take the item out of a `Slot` and leave it empty, so the caller writes no `slot = null` line. `append`, `prepend` and `insertAfter` assert against the container's own contents under runtime safety. `concat` asserts its two arguments are different lists. `is_linked` is documented for what it computes: whether the node has neighbours, which is false for a list's only member.

API 8 doc-comment sync (rules-030): `ItemList._list` reworded — "underneath" and "on purpose" are banned words, and the entry now matches the field's doc comment in `src/polynode.zig`.

API 8: `ItemList` — the toolkit's list type. `Mbox.receive_batch`, `Mbox.close`, `Pool.put_all`, `Pool.Hooks.on_put`, and `Pool.Hooks.on_close` speak it instead of `std.DoublyLinkedList`. `popFirst` yields `ItemHandle` and clears the links, so `@fieldParentPtr` no longer appears in application code.


| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| 042 | 2026-08-14 | INTR 8-3. `new` fills a Slot in both tools, so every snippet that took a returned pointer is rewritten: declare the Slot, call `new`, detach with `moveFromSlot` on the next line. Part 5 loses a step. The pool's `Usual flow` drops from five steps to four, because the hooks are a parameter of `new` and there is no second call that arms the pool; both tools now read the same four steps, and step 1 on each side carries the detach and the empty-Slot precondition. `Pool.init` is gone from the signature group, its text folded into `new`. Both Create-and-destroy groups gain `destroy_slot`. The pool's item-state diagram loses the two-box opening — a pool with no hooks is no longer a state that exists. The `get` preconditions drop "the pool initialized" for the same reason. Step 1 on each side also binds the reading word to the call: the step is called detaching, the call is always `moveFromSlot`, and Part 4 says why they differ — `move` is the toolkit's word for every transfer, and a Slot is a place rather than a linkage. Parts 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 are untouched. |
| 041 | 2026-08-13 | API 13-4. Custody-sense wording reconciled with `src/`. The mailbox statement in Part 4 now reads "The mailbox keeps items. It never touches them.", matching `src/mailbox.zig` after the 13-4a rewrite. One Part 2 line says the list is passed the `*Node` rather than given it. Changelog rows are left as written — they record what an earlier stage did. No section moved, no contract changed. |
| 040 | 2026-08-13 | API 13-3. The book sheds the detail that 13-2 wrote into `src/`. The line it cuts on: a precondition the caller has to satisfy stays, the assert mechanism goes. All nine `Assert:` blocks are gone; where the surrounding bullets did not already say the precondition, one line of prose does. Out of Parts 3 to 5: the two-checks-per-insert reasoning, the O(n) cost of the safety checks, the `concatByMoving` and header-consistency explanations, the `!is_linked` assert site list — which named five sites where the code has seven — the `in_pool_count` lock mechanics, the pool's internal lock order, and the reentrancy reasoning. The `init` precondition "each tag not null" is deleted rather than moved: no such assert exists in `src/`, and `hooks.tags` holds non-optional pointers, so none can. Kept against their carry-over row, by the owner's ruling: the OOB ordering diagram, the two-`popFirst` warning trimmed to two bullets, and the two behavioural contracts a reader designs around — waiter order is not FIFO, and the pool gives no put-then-get sequence guarantee. Parts 1, 2, 6 and 7 are untouched. |
| 039 | 2026-08-13 | API 13-1. The reference becomes a book for the reader who is learning Matryoshka. 22 flat `##` headings become seven parts, and Parts 3, 4 and 5 share one five-piece shape: what this is, participants, usual flow, the API in named groups, where to go deeper. New Part 1 states what Matryoshka is, what it is for, who it is for and what it is not. New Part 2 gives the three parts of Zig the toolkit is built out of — intrusion, type erasure, and the `*Node`-plus-`@fieldParentPtr` handle this book calls `ParentHandle`; its snippets come from a new test file, `tests/zig_mechanisms.zig`, and `ItemHandle` moves out of the opening lines into Part 3, where it is introduced as the analog with a tag added. Every code snippet in Parts 2 through 5 is extracted from a file a kitchen script already builds, and names its source. The pool part gains a `Hooks` section one level above `Get` and `Put`, last in the part, because hooks are written rather than called. 475 lines of manual type definition and `PolyHelper` walkthrough are removed in favour of pointers to the two hand-maintained pages that already carry them on the docs site. The complexity table is removed — it was never for the reader. Bare signature lists are replaced by grouped signatures, each with its description. The stale note naming this file the source for `///` doc comments is removed: the code is working, and the flow is now the other way. The dead `Addendums → Io 101` pointer becomes a link to the page. Part 6 groups the eleven cross-tool sections into four, by the owner's ruling: identity across the tools, the slot rule, concurrency and cancel, what the toolkit assumes. The grouping demotes the eleven one level and reorders them into their group; no section body is rewritten. |
| 038 | 2026-08-13 | FLOW 1-1r. Both `Usual flow` sections rewritten in staccato. The wording of 037 was prose. Each numbered step is now a heading line with nested bullets under it, one fact per line, split at every colon, "and" and semicolon. The counting introductions are gone: "Four steps. Two set up, two take down." for `mailbox`, "Five steps. Three set up, two take down." for `pool`. The three trailing paragraphs on each side — close before destroy, `destroy` is not optional, teardown is the sharpest difference — are now a short lead line plus a bullet list, the same shape on both sides. No statement changed meaning. Code blocks, diagrams and every other section are untouched. |
| 037 | 2026-08-12 | FLOW 1-1. The canonical `Usual flow` text. `mailbox` gains a four-step account — create, use, close and release the returned list, destroy — and `pool` a five-step one, with `init(hooks)` as the step that was documented nowhere. Both state that close comes before destroy always, that `destroy` is not optional because the container is an allocation separate from the items, and that teardown is the sharpest difference between the two: a mailbox returns items to the caller, a pool passes them to `on_close`. The pool flow diagram gains `init` at the top and `destroy` at the bottom; its heading, which used the same word as the section below, is now `Flow diagram`. The section describing item states was named for two things it should not have been named for and is now `Item states`. One reworded sentence in `pool`: a closed pool *gives* items back. The new ban applies to the whole file, so nine other live uses went with it — the pool's one-line summary, the layer-combination table and both combination lists now say "item reuse", the `no_create_destroy` note says the two types create and destroy themselves, and the Slot diagram is `Slot states`. Older changelog rows are left as they are. |
| 036 | 2026-08-12 | PROSE 1 banned-word pass. One live hit: the `@fieldParentPtr` walkthrough diagram said `dll_node_ptr` where the surrounding text and code already said `list_node_ptr`. `dll` is banned — it clashes with Windows DLL. Changelog rows that name a banned word to record its earlier removal are left as they are; rewriting them would erase the record. |
| 035 | 2026-08-12 | MBOX 1. `mailbox` section opens with "The mailbox holds. It never touches." and the four edges that hand an item back to a caller; `close` documents the caller's release duty and bans `_ = mbx.close()`; `send`/`send_oob` document that `error.Closed` leaves the slot unchanged; `receive_batch` gets the same release duty. `pool` section gains the mirror statements: the pool touches items through hooks, a closed pool hands items back via `put`/`put_all`, and `close` releases through `on_close` rather than through the caller. Removed 15 documented asserts of the form `mailbox.is_it_you(mbx.*.tag)` / `pool.is_it_you(pl.*.tag)` — no such assert exists in `src/`, and neither struct has a `.tag` field. |
| 027 | 2026-07-28 | API 6. Renamed `identifyNodeAs`→`fromNode`, `mustIdentifyNodeAs`→`mustFromNode`, `identifySlotAs`→`fromSlot`, `mustIdentifySlotAs`→`mustFromSlot` — the old names described the implementation, not the caller's action. Hard rename, no aliases. Added `moveFromSlot(slot: *Slot) ?*T`: checks the tag, returns the item, clears the Slot on success, leaves it unchanged on failure, asserts the item is not linked. No `must` variant — it mutates its argument. PolyHelper section gains the inspection-vs-extraction split; `no_create_destroy` lists and diagram updated. |
| 023 | 2026-07-09 | INTR 7. `pool` section: "Pool is not storage" stated up front; `put`'s four hook-driven outcomes documented (deleted/no-return, returned as-is, returned after reset, deleted-and-replaced); added the no-fixed-sequence-guarantee caveat for put/get call patterns. |
| 022 | 2026-07-09 | New Mindset. Master connected to `io.concurrent()` up front — "Master is an architectural role" replaced with "Master is an Io task that follows the Matryoshka rules." No other content change. |
| 021 | 2026-07-07 | API 4. Renamed `NodeHandle` → `ItemHandle` throughout — the old name leaked the intrusive-node implementation detail. `*Mbox`/`*Pool` aliases unchanged in meaning. `### What is a NodeHandle?` renamed to `### What is an ItemHandle?`, with a naming-rationale note and the `handle`/`ih` shorthand convention. Historical Change-log rows referencing `NodeHandle` left as-is. |
| 020 | 2026-07-06 | DOC 18. Humanized the reference: dropped "ownership" framing throughout (section titles, diagrams, prose) in favor of plain language — a handle sits in exactly one place, in exactly one state, at any moment. Converted remaining prose paragraphs to staccato bullets. No content removed, no reordering, no new API surface.
| 019 | 2026-07-05 | DOC 10. Dependency-ordered re-partition — no content change. send/receive ownership diagrams moved from Ownership model into mailbox. Tag identity (class, not instance) moved out of polynode to its own section after pool. Slot-based programming and Cooperative cleanup patterns moved after pool — every function they reference is now introduced first.
| 018 | 2026-07-05 | DOC 9. Re-partitioned and reordered into a logical, teachable structure (was development-order). Generic `std.Io` material (Prolog, io.concurrent/Io.Group/Io.Select internals) moved to new `## Addendums` / `### Io 101` section at the end. Dropped the `Change manifest (NNN)` blocks (16 sections) — downstream-propagation notes fully subsumed by current main-body content, kept only as this Change log table. No information removed; no new API surface.
| 017 | 2026-07-05 | API 3. Added `mailbox.wakeUpAll()` — wakes every receiver currently blocked in `receive()` with `error.Wakeup`, no item sent, future receivers unaffected. `receive()` error set gains `error.Wakeup`. `Mbox.Result` gains `wakeup: void`. |
| 016 | 2026-07-02 | API 2. Renamed `cast`→`identifyNodeAs`, `mustCast`→`mustIdentifyNodeAs`. Added `identifySlotAs` and `mustIdentifySlotAs` for application code that works with Slots directly. Updated `no_create_destroy` diagram. Updated violation example in "No raw allocator calls". |
| 015 | 2026-06-28 | INTR 4 fixes. Bug 3.1: Pool.put_all thread-safety table corrected (NOT atomic wrt close). Bug 1.2: Pattern 1 extended with double-defer for closed-pool fallback. Bug 1.3: get_wait zero-timeout documents intentional error divergence from available_only. Bug 1.4: Slot rule exception note for receiveResult/getWaitResult. Bug 2.3: stdlib compatibility section — polynode.reset warning after popFirst(). |
| 014 | 2026-06-28 | INTR 2 thread-safe hooks + hook concurrency contract. CappedPoolCtx io/mutex/count fields. in_pool_count semantics. |
| 013 | 2026-06-28 | `## Prolog: std.Io` — corrected `Io.Select` description (Queue(U)+Group, not Future container). Updated event source diagram and added direct push pattern. Added `receiveResult` and `getWaitResult` as primary blocking functions. Updated `receive_future` and `get_wait_future` as thin wrappers (no heap allocation). Updated cancel contract table. Updated Master event source diagram. Added `#### Io.Select — internals` subsection (verified fields, select.concurrent mechanics, direct push, ICE agent reference). Added args-copying note to `#### io.concurrent`. Fixed `fires` → `runs` ×5 in slot-based programming code comments. |
| 012 | 2026-06-27 | New rule `### No raw allocator calls on PolyNode-based types` in `## Cooperative cleanup patterns`. Violation/correct/exempt code examples. |
| 011 | 2026-06-27 | New `## Slot-based programming` section: slot rule, lifecycle diagram, ownership-transfer diagram, defer-before-acquisition diagram. New `## Cooperative cleanup patterns` section: four patterns with code + diagrams. New `### PolyHelper — create and destroy` subsection: create/destroy functions, old-vs-new comparison, no_create_destroy comptime selection. Updated Pool.put: null slot is now a no-op (no-op bullet added, assert clarified). |
| 010 | 2026-06-26 | New `### io.concurrent and Io.Group — verified call syntax` subsection in Master section. Covers exact call patterns (verified from std/Io.zig + ICE agent), no-io-injection rule, worker return type constraint, Future resource rules, Io backend selection for Layer 4 tests and examples. |
| 009 | 2026-06-26 | Tag identity section: class vs instance, infra handles have no user-visible fields, worker-finish-signal pattern, wrapper pattern for role discrimination. |
| 008 | 2026-06-26 | Pool ownership flow diagram. Ownership invariants section. Cancellation ownership contract section. Thread-safety contract table. Complexity guarantees table. Zero timeout semantics in receive and get_wait. Multiple waiter fairness note. Strengthened hook reentrancy rules. |
| 001 | 2026-06-20 | Initial API reference (Proposal 8) |
| 002 | 2026-06-23 | Proposal 27: `MayItem` → `Slot`, `*PolyNode` → `NodeHandle`. Visual ownership model added to intro. `*Mbox = NodeHandle`, `*Pool = NodeHandle`. All "item" language updated to "handle" in descriptions. |
| 003 | 2026-06-23 | Proposal 28: Validation/assert specifications. `std.debug.assert` on every API function. `AlreadyInUse` removed from `GetError` (contract violation, not runtime error). Contract Violations section expanded. |
| 004 | 2026-06-23 | Proposal 29: `Pool.put` open/closed behavior clarified. Proposal 30: `receive_select` and `get_wait_select` removed — `Future` composes directly with `Io.Select`, dedicated Select adapters are unnecessary API surface. |
| 005 | 2026-06-24 | Proposal 31: Reformat for readability and `///` doc comment use. Cancel indicator rule. Cancel table corrected. Event source concept added to Master with diagrams. Mailbox Integration section merged into Event source helpers. Informal terms cleaned up. |
| 006 | 2026-06-24 | Proposal 32: Staccato rhythm for all prose. Every non-function section reformatted: short intro then bullets. Comma-separated lists broken into bullet lists. |
