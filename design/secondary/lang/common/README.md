# lang/common — what binds every port

The Matryoshka port family is **otk** (Odin), **ztk** (Zig, this repo), **3tk**  
(C3) and **dtk** (D). Each has its own folder beside this one, holding its own  
plan, status, log, notes and code.

This folder holds what is **not** any one port's: the documents every port is  
written from, and the process every port follows.

## What is here

- **[matryoshka-specification-005.md](matryoshka-specification-005.md)** — the
  portable specification. Self-contained and language-neutral. *A port is  
  written from this file alone.* Source of truth for all four ports.  
  **005 replaced 004 on 2026-08-28**, and changes one Part: 11.12 required a  
  container to be **closed** before release and now requires it to be **closed  
  and quiet** — closed, and with no call the application made still running.  
  Close ends no call that is already running, so a caller who obeyed 004 could  
  still release a container out from under a waiting receive or a put inside its  
  hook. **The obligation is split**: every port states the precondition, and a  
  port checks it where a check is cheap. It is a check and never a wait. Found  
  by the C3 port in code, ruled by its owner on 2026-08-28, written here by  
  stage 3TK-52.  
  **004 had replaced 003 on 2026-08-24**, and changed one Part: 7.1 stated ztk's  
  mechanism — a helper object bound to one type — where the design has only the  
  promise that the crossings exist per type and are generated. It was the  
  fifteenth instance of the mistake 003 fixed fourteen times, and the first  
  specification defect found by *building* a port rather than auditing one.  
  **003 had replaced 002 the same day**, from the C3 port's deviation audit: a  
  port written from 002 would have reproduced Zig's doubly-linked list, its  
  anchor and its inexact link test. Two realizations appear side by side,  
  marked *ztk* and *3tk*. The change log names every difference across all  
  four versions, so nothing needs diffing.
- **[ztk-audit-001.md](ztk-audit-001.md)** — read-only evidence about ztk, the
  reference implementation. Every claim names a file and a line range. It is the  
  specification's own input, and it is about Zig, not about any port.
- **[port-flow-001.md](port-flow-001.md)** — how a port is run. The process
  3tk proved, written as process, with C3's answers left out.
- `backup/` — superseded versions of the above. Nothing is deleted.

## The rule this folder exists to enforce

**A port folder never copies these files. It links to them.**

The specification lived inside `c3/` until 2026-08-23, and the cost showed up  
the first time it was reviewed: two of the twenty-seven items raised against the  
C3 proposal were *specification* defects. Had they been fixed only in the C3  
document, the same trap would have been left set for D and Odin. A shared input  
that lives in one consumer's folder is a fork waiting to happen.

So a defect found by any port against these documents is fixed **here**, once,  
in a new version — and the other ports read the new version.

## The rule about borrowing from a port folder

`port-flow-001.md` is here because it is process. Everything else a finished  
port produced — its capability study, its proposal, its notes — stays in that  
port's folder. Those are worth reading, and they are **not** worth copying: they  
are one language's answers, and the next language's questions are only sometimes  
the same. `port-flow-001.md` says which is which.

## Where the ports are

| Port | Language | Folder | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| ztk | Zig | this repo's `src/` | the reference implementation; green, needs tuning |
| 3tk | C3 | [`../c3/3tk-status.md`](../c3/3tk-status.md) | the port that has driven every specification version since 002 |
| dtk | D | [`../d/dtk-status.md`](../d/dtk-status.md) | prepared, no stage has run |
| otk | Odin | `../odin/` | needs refactoring; no status file yet |
