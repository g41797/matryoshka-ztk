# The 3tk porting proposal (004)

Stage 3TK-5 of `3tk-staging-plan-001.md`, **accepted by the owner 2026-08-23**  
after 3TK-6 and 3TK-7 built it. Revised by **3TK-8** of
[3tk-staging-plan-004.md](backup/3tk-staging-plan-004.md), 2026-08-23.

The C3 shape of Matryoshka. Written from
[matryoshka-specification-002.md](../common/backup/matryoshka-specification-002.md), the ruled
review [3tk-drafts-review-001.md](3tk-drafts-review-001.md), and the measured  
answers of [c3-capabilities-001.md](c3-capabilities-001.md).

Idiomatic C3. Not transliterated Zig.

## Status

All sixteen decisions in this file are **accepted by the owner, 2026-08-23**.

Version 001 proposed them. 3TK-6 and 3TK-7 implemented them and produced the  
findings incorporated here. **No accepted decision has changed across four  
versions.** Each version since has changed only the realization, where  
implementation disproved or refined an earlier assumption — and in 004, where a  
review disproved an *argument* while leaving its conclusion standing. D1 is that  
case, and the owner reaffirmed the ruling on 2026-08-23 with a better reason  
than the document had been giving.

Rejected alternatives stay in the text, because the reason a thing was chosen  
outlives the choosing.

## What changed in 004

004 answers [`3tk-porting-proposal-003-review.md`](backup/3tk-porting-proposal-003-review.md),  
a review of **design and implementation** rather than of prose. Its 28 items  
were read against `3tk/src/` before any of them was accepted — the discipline  
003 used, and the reason 003 could reject three of the previous review's  
findings.

**The review's central finding is right, and D1's argument was wrong.** Not its  
ruling. D1 said hiding the container internals must cost Part 11.1's MUST,  
having weighed two shapes. A third exists, and the port now says so. **The owner  
ruled on 2026-08-23:** the ruling stands, no code changes for the sake of  
hiding — *"I don't like wars with language."* That reason is stronger than the  
one it replaces, and D1 below is rewritten around it.

| Kind | What |
|---|---|
| Rewritten | **D1's argument**, on the owner's ruling. Nine measured answers behind it — Q13 to Q17, M1 to M5 — where 003 inferred |
| Corrected | The Part 4.2 mapping row and D12, which still said "a third field". The 24 bytes, an observation and not an invariant. Part 15.2's lock statement, current rather than timeless |
| Added | **Section 6, the implementation invariants** — six rules the code already honours and no document stated. Including the `AnyHandle`/`Slot` signature rule, with the audit that found no violation |
| Fixed in code | **Creation is now a transaction.** Neither `Pool.create` nor `Mailbox.create` cleaned up after a partial failure. Section 9 |
| Rejected | The `char[N]` opaque storage of the review's §7, for the reasons the review itself gives |
| Deferred | The `NodeList` mutation core of its §15, with the reason recorded rather than dropped |
| Confirmed | Five items the code already satisfied, three of them better than the review assumed. They became section 6 rather than changes |

The nine measurements live in D1, folded in from  
`3tk-porting-proposal-addendum-001.md`, which this file supersedes.  
`c3-capabilities-001.md` is **not** amended — it is the 3TK-4 output and records  
what was true when that stage ran. Owner's ruling: one home for the  
measurements, beside the decision they support.

## What changed in 003

003 answers `3tk-porting-proposal-review.md`. That review read this document  
closely and did not read `3tk/src/`, which is why most of its findings are  
places the **text had drifted behind the code** rather than defects in either.

Three of its findings are not corrections to this file at all. They were  
defects in the specification, and they were fixed there:  
**[matryoshka-specification-002.md](../common/backup/matryoshka-specification-002.md)** now  
separates Part 4.2's two conceptual parts from its three fields, states in  
Parts 11.6 and 11.8 that a closed container is empty, and carries that as  
**invariant 34**. This file is written against 002.

| Kind | What |
|---|---|
| Corrections | Three counting contradictions: seven-vs-nine helper members, two-parts-vs-three-fields, sixteen-vs-fifteen list operations |
| Additions | The central boundary, section 0. The Slot primitives, `AnyHandle`'s nullability, the `@check` side-effect rule, `Pool.put`'s two Slot domains, the `NodeList` count invariant, the bucket set's construction rules |
| Rejected | The review's suggestion that `wake_all` stop reporting `CLOSED`. Part 19.1 fixes that outcome set, and the port is right |
| Dissolved | The review's `receive_all` precedence question. Invariant 34 makes the state it asks about unreachable |
| Deferred | Its §20 finding classes and §24 restructure into appendices. Both are large edits to how the document is arranged rather than to what it says |

One code change came out of the review — `Pool.create` now refuses a duplicate  
identity — and one defect came out of building it, which the review could not  
have seen: **a tier 1 negative had never compiled**, and the test harness had  
been reading its compile failure as the abort it was supposed to prove. Both  
are in section 8.

**What changed in 002**, kept here because the findings are still the record.  
Only what the code proved wrong, and none of it moved a decision:

| Where | Was | Now | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| Section 1 | the containers in `module mtk` | `module mtk::mailbox`, `module mtk::pool` | **G1**, accepted by the owner |
| Section 1 | `alias msg = mtk::helper{Msg}` | one alias per declaration | F4 |
| D6's macro | `@check` is `@private`, message is a `String` | public, message is compile-time | F3, F5 |
| Section 5.9 | `HashMap{typeid, Bucket}` | a flat `PoolBucket[]` | G4 |
| Section 5.9 | one Slot through `put` | two Slots, and why | G5 |
| Section 5.10 | unqualified names | module-qualified | G1 |
| Section 8.2 | the safe optimized build is `-O3` | `--safe=yes -O3` | **F1** |
| Section 9 | what 3TK-6 would be | what 3TK-6 and 3TK-7 did | — |
| throughout | `return CLOSED?` | `return mtk::CLOSED~` | G2 |

`3tk-porting-proposal-001.md` and `3tk-porting-proposal-002.md` stay on disk,  
superseded.

## What this file is not

- Not code. No `.c3` file was written by stage 3TK-5. Later revisions of this
  file have named code changes and then had them made — 003's duplicate-identity  
  check is one — but the code is always a separate act, and the four builds have  
  to be green before the revision is finished.
- Not a schedule. Part 22's order is adopted, not dated.
- Not a re-derivation. Where the specification already rules, this file cites
  and does not restate.

# 0. The port's central boundary

One rule, and most of this document is a consequence of it.

- **Application code owns outer types.** `mtk` never sees one, never names one,
  and has no list of them.
- **`mtk` owns the inner protocol** — `AnyNode`, `AnyHandle`, `Slot`,
  `NodeList` — and the rules those four obey.
- **The per-type helper is the only named border** between an application's
  outer and the toolkit's inner. It is generated per type, and every piece of  
  offset arithmetic in the port is inside it.
- **Application code never performs the crossing by hand.** Part 7.5 MUST.
- **A Slot moves a handle without exposing an outer type.** That is why a
  container can carry an item whose type it could not name.

Read the decisions as consequences and they stop being a list. D2 refuses  
`inline` because an implicit conversion is a crossing that appears at no call  
site and so escapes the border. D4 refuses typed handles because the border  
already separates a `Mailbox*` from a `Pool*`, once, instead of at every call  
site. D5 makes the Slot distinct so the compiler can tell a container of a  
handle from a handle. D10 splits the helper in two because create and release  
belong to the border and not every type wants them. Part 17's layering is the  
same rule at file scale: the containers hold only handles and Slots, so they  
sit above the toolkit rather than inside it.

The four words of Part 10.1 exist to keep the boundary readable in a signature:  
**inner** is the embedded structure, **handle** is a pointer to one, **Slot** is  
a container of one handle or of nothing, **item** is the outer the application  
wrote.

# 1. The shape in one screen

```
src/
  any.c3      module mtk           AnyNode, AnyHandle, Slot, the faults, @check
  list.c3     module mtk           NodeList — the intrusive list and its checks
  helper.c3   module mtk::helper   <Type> — the per-type border
  owned.c3    module mtk::owned    <Type> — helper plus create and release
  mailbox.c3  module mtk::mailbox  Mailbox
  pool.c3     module mtk::pool     Pool, PoolHooks, GetMode
  mtk.c3      module mtk           the port's identity and reading order
```

Seven files. The first four are the toolkit of Part 17.1; `mailbox.c3` and  
`pool.c3` are the two optional tools of Part 17.2.

**The containers are submodules on purpose — G1, and the owner accepted it.**  
Part 17.2 says they are built *on* the intrusive layer *with no privileged  
access to it*, and Part 17.3 calls that the test of the design. A C3 submodule  
cannot see its parent's `@private` declarations, so putting them in  
`mtk::mailbox` and `mtk::pool` makes **the core's explicit private boundary  
compiler-enforced** rather than a promise the authors keep. It costs an explicit  
`mtk::` on every fault the containers return, which is exactly what a caller  
from outside pays.

**What it does not prove**, and 002 overstated this: D1 chose public structs  
with public fields, so coupling to the core's *public* surface stays possible.  
The compiler stops `mtk::mailbox` from calling a `@private` declaration of  
`mtk`; it does not stop it reading a public field it has no business reading.  
That half is held by the Part 17.2 layering rule and the check section 7 runs  
for it — a convention, tested, and honest about being one.

`mtk.c3` is not a front door. C3 needs no re-export: `import mtk` brings in  
everything `module mtk` declares across every file that declares it. The module  
is the front door, and the file carries the port's identity and reading order.

The core types:

```c3
module mtk;

struct AnyNode
{
    AnyNode* prev;
    AnyNode* next;
    typeid   type;
}

alias   AnyHandle = AnyNode*;      // transparent. A handle is a pointer to an inner.
typedef Slot      = AnyHandle;     // distinct. A container of one handle, or nothing.
```

**Two conceptual parts, three fields.** Part 4.2 of the specification fixes the  
parts — linkage, and stored identity — and leaves the field count to the  
realization. Here linkage is `prev` and `next`, identity is `type`, and the  
whole inner is three words: 24 bytes on linux-x64.

**That number is an observation, never a requirement.** The invariant is *two  
pointer links and one identity value*; the size follows from the target. No  
code in the port depends on `sizeof(AnyNode) == 24` and none may be added that  
does — a port on another target will measure something else and be just as  
correct.

The distinction matters because D3 turns on it. What Part 4.2 guards is not the  
number three; it is **a further per-item field**, of any kind, that every item  
in the program would pay for. D3 refuses an allocator on exactly that test, and  
the refusal would read as arithmetic if the parts and the fields were the same  
thing.

## The Slot's surface

`Slot` is distinct, so it cannot be read with the language's bare null test —  
Part 9.9 predicted that cost. These five are the replacement, and they are  
ordinary functions on `Slot`, not macros. `any.c3`:

```c3
fn bool      Slot.is_empty(&self)               // Part 9.1: the item is elsewhere
fn bool      Slot.is_full(&self)                // Part 9.1: the item is here, and mine
fn AnyHandle Slot.peek(&self)                   // look; the Slot is UNCHANGED
fn AnyHandle Slot.take(&self)                   // take; the Slot is CLEARED. Rule 5
fn void      Slot.fill(&self, AnyHandle h)      // place; refuses to overwrite. Rule 1
```

Four things about them are load-bearing:

- **`peek` does not clear and `take` does.** Every transfer in the port is a
  `take` on one side and a `fill` on the other, and the pair is where Part 9.2  
  rule 5 lives.
- **Only a `Slot*` moves ownership.** `is_full` and `peek` are questions; the
  two that change the Slot both take it by reference.
- **`fill` carries rule 1**, once, for the whole toolkit. It is the single
  most-repeated contract in the port and it is written in one place.
- **They are not crossings.** They interpret a Slot as the handle it holds,
  which is bookkeeping inside one layer. The **outer ↔ inner** crossing — the  
  one Part 7.5 confines to a single file — is only ever the helper's. D5's  
  friction is at that border, not at these five.

## `AnyHandle` and null

`AnyHandle` is a plain nullable pointer, and the port uses null for exactly one  
thing: **the natural "no item" answer of an operation that cannot fail.**  
`NodeList.pop_front`, `pop_back`, `front` and `back` return null on an empty  
list, because Part 19.4 says no list operation has an outcome to report.

Everywhere absence is part of an outcome contract, it is a fault and never a  
null — `EMPTY`, `TIMEOUT`, `NOT_AVAILABLE`, `NOT_CREATED`. So the four states a  
reader has to keep apart are:

| State | Means |
|---|---|
| a null `AnyHandle` | a non-failing list primitive found nothing |
| an empty `Slot` | the item is somewhere else, and not this holder's problem |
| `mtk::EMPTY~` | a poll found the mailbox open and with nothing in it |
| `mtk::TIMEOUT~`, `mtk::NOT_AVAILABLE~`, `mtk::NOT_CREATED~` | a named runtime condition, Part 19 |

The border, for one outer type:

```c3
struct Msg { int id; AnyNode node; char[64] body; }   // inner at any offset

alias msg_init     = mtk::helper::init{Msg};          // one alias per declaration
alias msg_from_any = mtk::helper::from_any{Msg};
alias msg_to_any   = mtk::helper::to_any{Msg};
```

A generic module instantiates per declaration, not as a whole — F4. A type that  
wants the full surface writes nine aliases, or instantiates inline at the call  
site as `owned.c3` does.

# 2. The decision register

Sixteen decisions. The eight carried by `c3-capabilities-001.md`, the eleven of  
the conflict register so far as they remain open, and the ten of Part 20.  
Overlapping, so sixteen rows and not twenty-nine.

All sixteen are **accepted**. The table gives the ruling; the sections after it  
give the argument and the alternative each one rejects.

| # | Decision | Ruling | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Hiding the container internals — Q4 | **Public struct, public fields.** Hiding is *possible* and is rejected on cost: C3 enforces no field privacy at any price, and every shape that hides costs an allocation per container | Q4, Q13-Q17, M5, Part 11.11 |
| D2 | `inline AnyNode`, or a plain field — C2 | **Plain field, at any offset.** No `inline` | C2, Part 7.5 |
| D3 | Allocators — C7, Part 20 decision 2 | **Containers keep one. Application items keep one in the *outer*, never in the inner.** No release call takes an allocator | C7, Part 13 |
| D4 | Typed handles `MboxHandle`, `PoolHandle` — C10 | **No.** One `AnyHandle` | C10, Part 7.5 |
| D5 | The Slot's own type — Part 20 decision 1 | **Distinct.** `typedef Slot = AnyHandle` | Q9, Part 9.9 |
| D6 | The assert policy | **Three tiers, one port macro.** Plain `assert` is never used for a contract violation | Q11, Part 15.5 |
| D7 | The timed wait | **Anchor once, loop on `wait_until`.** `wait_timeout` is banned in the port | Q7, Part 2.5 |
| D8 | The names — C3, C11 | **`mtk`, `AnyNode`, `AnyHandle`, `Slot`, `NodeList`, `Mailbox`, `Pool`.** Not `AnyList`, not `polynode` | C3, C11, Q1 |
| D9 | Interruption — Part 20 decision 8 | **Dropped.** The outcome set loses `interrupted` | Q7, Part 2.9 |
| D10 | One helper, or two — Part 20 decision 3 | **Two generic modules**, `helper` and `owned` | Part 7.3 |
| D11 | The porting order — C8 | **Part 22 as written.** The list is step 5 | C8, Part 22 |
| D12 | The link test's blind spot — Part 20 decision 4 | **Accepted.** No membership field | Part 8.7 |
| D13 | Poll beside receive — Part 20 decision 5 | **Both.** They differ in how empty is reported | Part 19.1 |
| D14 | Out-of-band — Part 20 decision 6 | **Kept**, one level, with the O(1) anchor | Part 11.3 |
| D15 | The outcome mechanism — Part 20 decision 7 | **C3 faults.** `faultdef`, matching the stdlib | Part 19 |
| D16 | The pre-lock fast path — Part 20 decision 9 | **Kept**, with the mandatory re-check | Part 15.4 |

Part 20 decision 10 — where the O(n) insert check lives on a port with no build  
modes — does not arise. C3 has build modes. D6 places it.

The rest of this section argues each one.

## D1 — Hiding the container internals

**Ruling: public struct, public fields. Reaffirmed by the owner 2026-08-23,  
with a different reason than 003 gave.**

Read this section as two things kept apart, because 003 ran them together and  
that is what the review caught:

- **Can** the container internals be hidden without breaking Part 11.1? **Yes.**
  003 said no. 003 was wrong.
- **Should** this port hide them? **No** — and the argument is cost, not
  impossibility.

### What 003 claimed, and why it was wrong

003 weighed two shapes and concluded that hiding *necessarily* costs Part 11.1's  
MUST:

- Option 1, a comment saying internal, is ztk. It claims nothing and gains
  nothing.
- Option 2, `typedef Pool = void`, buys real hiding and sells a MUST for a
  SHOULD. Part 11.1 MUST says the two containers **are themselves items**. A  
  `typedef Pool = void` embeds nothing; the property has to be re-established  
  through `PoolImpl`, and the type the application names is no longer the type  
  the toolkit describes.

Option 2's reasoning still holds — *for option 2*. The error was treating it as  
the only way to hide. A third shape exists:

```c3
struct Pool
{
    AnyNode   node;
    Allocator _alloc;
    PoolImpl* _impl;      // the operational state, hidden
}
```

`Pool` is still the type the application names. It still embeds `AnyNode`, still  
crosses through `mtk::helper{Pool}`, still sits on a `NodeList`, still travels  
through a mailbox. **Part 11.1 is satisfied literally.** Only the operational  
state moves.

The review states the confusion precisely, and the statement is worth keeping:

> **A.** The container is itself an item. **B.** Every byte of the container's
> implementation state is physically inside the same public struct. Part 11.1
> requires A. D1 assumed A implies B. That implication needs proof.

It has none. **Hiding costs an indirection. It does not cost Part 11.1.**

### What C3 0.8.3 actually permits — measured, not inferred

Nine probes, against `c3c` 0.8.3, git `1d155ee`, LLVM 22.1.8, linux-x64 — the  
toolchain of `c3-capabilities-001.md`, so these extend Q1 to Q12 rather than  
restating them. Q13 to Q17 were measured for this decision; M1 to M5 came from  
the owner's questions of the same day and are folded in from  
`3tk-porting-proposal-addendum-001.md`.

| # | Question | Answer |
|---|---|---|
| **Q13** | May a public struct hold a field whose type is `@private` to the module? | **Yes.** Compiles, runs, and the module's own methods use it normally |
| **Q14** | May another module *name* that private type? | **No.** *"The struct 'Impl' in lib is '@private' and not visible from other modules"* |
| **Q15** | May another module assign the field anyway — `b.impl = null`? | **Yes.** The field is reachable even when its type is not nameable |
| **Q16** | May an incomplete `struct Impl;` be embedded **by value** with the definition private? | **No, and not for the expected reason.** C3 0.8.3 has no forward struct declaration at all: `struct Impl;` is a parse error, *"Expected '{'"* |
| **Q17** | Does the `typedef PoolState = void` + private cast fallback work? | **Yes**, and it is forgeable: another module may cast any pointer into it. Less type-safe than Q13, exactly as the review's §26 predicted |
| **M1** | Is there UFCS — may `f(handle, ...)` be called as `handle.f(...)`? | **No.** Method functions only, `fn void Type.f(&self)` |
| **M2** | Do method functions give the dotted call? | **Yes.** Every dotted call in the port is one |
| **M3** | May a method be declared on a type from another module? | **Yes.** The association is open, not owner-only |
| **M4** | May a method attach to a pointer alias? | **No.** *"Methods can not be associated with 'Node*'"* — see D5 |
| **M5** | Is there field-level privacy? | **No, at any price.** `@private` on a field is refused outright; on a struct it hides the *type name* only; `inline` makes it worse |

**M5 is the one that decides this section**, and it came from the owner asking  
the sharpest version of the question: restrict *fields* without restricting  
*functions*. The shape was a `@private` fields-only struct, `inline` inside the  
public container — transparent to `mtk`'s own methods, closed to an application.  
Six probes say C3 0.8.3 does not deliver it. Another module still reads, writes  
and takes the address of every field, and the write lands. `inline` is worse  
than a named field, because it lifts the hidden members into the outer's own  
namespace: `mb.closed` needs no `.guts` at all. And `inline` must be the *first*  
field, which puts it in competition with `AnyNode node` for position.

So there is no shape that hides container state **while leaving it inside the  
object**. Every mechanism that works — the `Impl*` pointer, the opaque  
`char[N]` — works by moving the state out.

### The ruling, and its reason

**Owner, 2026-08-23:** *"I don't like wars with language. If it does not support  
the feature + I need additional allocation — better not change code and add  
comment and update docs."*

That is the decision and it is the whole argument:

- C3 0.8.3 **enforces no field privacy at any price** (M5). Whatever the port
  builds, an application that wants to reach `pool._closed` will reach it.
- The shapes that *would* hide the state each cost **one extra allocation, one
  extra pointer, two-level destruction, a partial-creation state and one  
  dereference per access** — per container.
- Paying that for a boundary the language will not keep is a bad trade. The port
  does not make it.

**Part 11.11 is skipped, and Part 0 requires the reason to be stated. This is  
it:** not that C3 makes hiding impossible — it does not — but that hiding costs  
an allocation and a lifetime rule per container, and buys a convention rather  
than an enforcement.

What the port does instead, and it is not nothing:

- Every internal free function and macro carries `@private`. That is
  declaration-level visibility, which C3 *does* have. **It does not extend to  
  methods**: the compiler says so out loud — *"'@private' modifiers are ignored  
  for method declarations"* — which is why `NodeList.unlink_no_repair` is named  
  for what it leaves undone and documented rather than hidden.
- The mutex, the condition variable and the closed flag are named with a leading
  underscore.
- **The fields are grouped by role** — item identity, synchronization, lifetime,
  container state — with a comment on each group. Owner's instruction: since the  
  language will not enforce the boundary, the comment *is* the boundary, and it  
  is where an application author looks. It also makes a future split  
  representation legible.
- No public method reads a field the application could not have derived.

An application that reads `pool.in_pool` has not broken an invariant. It has  
read a stale hint — which is what Part 12.4 says that number is even to a hook.

### What the helper border does and does not do

003 said *the helper border does the work*. The review is right that this  
overstates it, and the correction matters because the two boundaries solve  
different problems:

- **The helper border protects the polymorphic representation boundary.** It is
  the only place `outer ↔ inner` arithmetic happens, and Part 7.5 MUST puts it  
  in one file. That is real and it is enforced.
- **It does not hide container operational state**, and was never able to. An
  application cannot legally cross `outer → AnyNode` by hand, but it can read  
  `Pool._buckets` — because C3 has no field privacy, M5.

The helper border is not a substitute for information hiding. It solves the  
crossing problem, completely. This section's subject is a different problem,  
solved by convention.

### The rejected alternative, kept because the reason outlives the choosing

**Split representation.** Public `Mailbox`/`Pool` embedding `AnyNode` and owning  
the allocator, pointing at a private `MailboxImpl`/`PoolImpl`:

- **Preserves** Part 11.1, the `AnyNode` embedding, `helper{Mailbox}`,
  `helper{Pool}`, every public operation, the Slot semantics and all observable  
  behaviour. Q13 confirms C3 permits the shape.
- **Costs** one pointer, one allocation, two-level destruction, a
  partial-creation state, one dereference per access — per container. And with  
  M5 in hand, it buys a convention, not an enforcement: the `_impl` field itself  
  stays assignable from outside (Q15).
- **Rejected on that trade**, by the owner, 2026-08-23. Not on Part 11.1.

If it is ever adopted, the allocator belongs in the **public** struct and not in  
the `Impl` — the review's §22, and it is right: outer lifetime state belongs to  
the outer, which is the same principle D3 already applies to application items.

**Opaque public storage**, `char[N]` with the private module treating it as  
`PoolImpl` — **rejected**, for the reasons the review's §7 gives against it:  
size and alignment become the public contract, changing the implementation  
breaks users, placement construction by hand, and the public type still exposes  
mysterious storage. Q17's opaque-typedef variant is the same family and is  
forgeable besides.

## D2 — A plain inner field, not `inline`

**Ruling: `AnyNode node;`, at whatever offset the outer's author likes. No  
`inline`.**

Both compile (Q3). The argument is Part 7.5 and Part 10.1, and the capability  
study is the first document in this folder to state it:

- `inline` makes `outer -> inner` an implicit conversion. The crossing then
  does not appear at the call site, and it does not appear in `helper.c3`  
  either. It appears nowhere.
- Part 7.5 MUST: *every crossing goes through the helper*, and that is *what
  makes the arithmetic auditable: it appears in one file*.
- Part 10.1: the four words — inner, handle, Slot, item — exist so a reader of
  a signature knows which side of the border they are on. An implicit  
  conversion erases the border at exactly the place the reader is looking.

The cost of the ruling is one call, `msg::to_any(m)`, where `inline` would have  
written nothing. Part 7.2 requires that function to exist regardless. So the  
cost is a call site, not a line of library code.

The gain beyond auditability: with no `inline`, `Msg` may embed its inner at  
any offset, and the port never has to reason about what an implicit conversion  
does in an overload or a generic context.

## D3 — Allocators

**Ruling, as one principle:** *a released object gets the allocator from its  
own lifetime state, so no release call in the port takes an allocator  
parameter.*

Where that state lives differs by what the object is, and that is the whole of  
the decision:

| Object | Keeps the allocator in | Released by |
|---|---|---|
| `Mailbox`, `Pool` | the container itself | `release`, with the kept allocator |
| An owning application item | its own **outer** | `mtk::owned::release` |
| A plain application item | nowhere. It has no toolkit release | the application's own code |

The inner is on none of those rows, and that is the sharp end: **the allocator  
belongs to whatever owns the allocation, never to the polymorphic inner.**

The three parts, argued:

1. **`Mailbox` and `Pool` keep an `Allocator` and release with it.** Part 13.1
   in full, including its sharp clause. Q8 verified the shape:  
   `alloc::free(self.alloc, self)`, no parameter. This is the half the  
   specification already settles, and ztk's mismatch (Part 13.3) does not exist  
   in the port.
2. **The inner does not grow an allocator field.** Part 4.2 MUST: a further
   per-item field is added only with a reason written down, because *every item  
   pays for it*. An allocator in `AnyNode` is 16 bytes on an interface value,  
   added to a 24-byte inner, on every item in the program, to serve the subset  
   of items the toolkit allocates. Refused — and refused as an **additional  
   per-item field**, which is the test Part 4.2 actually sets, not as "a third  
   field" in a struct that already has three.
3. **An item that wants a release with no allocator parameter keeps the
   allocator in its own outer, and takes the `owned` helper.** This is the new  
   part, and it is what makes 1 and 2 compatible.

`mtk::owned <Type>` is the create-and-release variant of D10. It discovers two  
fields by compile-time reflection, not one:

```c3
module mtk::owned <Type>;

// $OFF   — offset of the AnyNode field.        Part 7.4, as in mtk::helper.
// $AOFF  — offset of the Allocator field.
$assert $OFF  >= 0 : "type " +++ Type::name +++ " has no AnyNode field";
$assert $AOFF >= 0 : "type " +++ Type::name +++ " has no Allocator field; use mtk::helper";

fn void create(Allocator a, Slot* slot);   // Part 9.8: creation fills a Slot
fn void release(Slot* slot);               // Part 13.1: no allocator parameter
```

`create` writes the allocator into the outer's field and the identity into the  
inner. `release` reads the allocator back out of the outer, frees, and clears  
the Slot — a no-op on an empty Slot, Part 9.2 rule 6.

**The order inside `create` is a contract, not an implementation detail.** An  
item reaches a Slot only once it is wholly a valid item, because Part 9.2 rule  
4 says a failing acquisition leaves the Slot unchanged, and a half-built item  
in a Slot would be a full Slot the caller has no way to use:

1. allocate the outer — `alloc::new_try`, not `alloc::new`, because the plain
   form aborts on failure and rule 4 would then have no path to be true on;
2. write the allocator into the outer's own field;
3. initialize the inner — links cleared, identity written, Part 5.4;
4. **only then** fill the Slot with the handle.

A failure at step 1 returns the fault with the Slot untouched. Steps 2 to 4  
cannot fail.

The `$assert` message names the alternative, which is the whole point of Part  
7.4's *the message names the offending type*: a type that does not want to pay  
the pointer is told, at build time, which helper it should have taken.

So Part 20 decision 2 is answered **per type, at the type's own choice**, and  
not once for the whole port. That is better than the binary the specification  
frames, and it costs one extra `$assert` and one extra offset lookup in a  
module that is generated anyway.

**This answers C7 and the first open question of `3tk-status.md` together**, as  
the review required.

*If the owner overrides* to "no application item keeps an allocator":  
`mtk::owned` loses its second `$assert` and gains an `Allocator` parameter on  
`release`, and Part 13.1's clause is knowingly broken for application items  
only. The two containers are unaffected either way.

## D4 — One handle type

**Ruling: no `MboxHandle`, no `PoolHandle`. One `AnyHandle`.**

Q9's second negative probe priced it: a distinct handle type does not convert,  
so every Slot-shaped call site writes `(AnyHandle*)&h`.

Part 7.5 MUST says application code never performs the crossing by hand and the  
arithmetic appears in one file. A cast at every call site is the exact opposite  
shape, and it is a cast the compiler cannot check — `(AnyHandle*)` on the wrong  
thing compiles.

Part 11.1 is the second argument and the stronger one. The containers are  
ordinary items with ordinary crossings. A `PoolHandle` says they are special.

What N4 wanted — static separation of the mailbox API from the pool API — is  
delivered by the *typed pointer*, which is where C3 already delivers it.  
`mbox::from_any(h)` returns a `Mailbox*` or nothing, and a `Mailbox*` cannot be  
passed to a pool function. The separation is at the border, once, rather than  
at every call site.

## D5 — A distinct Slot

**Ruling: `typedef Slot = AnyHandle`. Distinct, not an alias.**

This pairs with D4 and does not contradict it. The cast cost that sinks typed  
*handles* does not arise for the Slot, because the Slot is the port's own  
currency and every function that takes one takes `Slot*` by design — Part 9.3.

**Where the friction is, precisely.** Reading a Slot as the handle it holds is  
handled by the five Slot primitives of section 1, and they are ordinary code  
that any layer may call — the containers do, and an application may. That is  
not a crossing and it is not confined to `helper.c3`.

The only thing Part 7.5 confines is the **outer/item ↔ inner/handle** crossing,  
and that stays in the per-type helper, all of it. The distinction is worth the  
sentence because the two are easy to blur: a reader who takes "every conversion  
involving a Slot lives in the helper" from this section will be contradicted by  
the port's own `mailbox.c3` on the next page.

What it buys, from Q9, verified in both directions:

- An `AnyHandle` cannot be passed where a `Slot` is wanted.
- A `Slot*` cannot be passed where an `AnyHandle*` is wanted.

So Part 9.2 rule 1 — never overwrite a full Slot — gains a compile-time ally:  
the two-star confusion that four drafts fell into (C4) does not typecheck.

A zero-initialized `Slot` is null, so rule 2 — a Slot starts empty — is the  
default state of the language, with no initializer to forget.

The cost Part 9.9 predicts is real: reading a distinct Slot needs  
`(AnyHandle)slot`, not the bare null test. The port supplies five functions on  
`Slot` — `is_empty`, `is_full`, `peek`, `take`, `fill`, listed with their  
signatures in section 1 — and the reading shape is then better than the bare  
null test, not worse, because `s.is_empty()` says which of the four absences of  
section 1 is meant and `!ptr` does not.

**C4 is settled by the word, not by the type.** The Slot is the container. The  
Slot is not `AnyHandle*`; `AnyHandle*` is a *pointer to* a Slot. In this port  
that distinction is enforced by the compiler, so the four drafts' usage is now  
unwritable.

## D6 — The assert policy

**Ruling: three tiers. A plain `assert` never guards a contract violation.  
**

Q11 found the trap: at `--safe=no` with optimization, a plain C3 `assert` is  
not a removed check, it is an *assumption the optimizer may act on*. A violated  
contract then produces undefined behaviour rather than a missed diagnostic. The  
probe segfaulted having printed nothing.

ztk's model — an assert either fires or is gone — does not survive the port. So  
the port does not use the mechanism that breaks it.

| Tier | Spelling | Where | Behaviour in a fast build |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `always_assert(cond, msg)` | Part 11.12 only | Aborts. Every build mode, no exception |
| 2 | `mtk::@check(cond, msg)` | every other contract violation | **Compiled out entirely, so the condition is not evaluated.** Not an assumption |
| 3 | `$if env::COMPILER_SAFE_MODE:` block | Part 8.6's walk | Not compiled at all |

Tier 2 is one port macro, and it is the reason this decision is a design  
contribution rather than a table:

```c3
macro @check(#cond, $msg)
{
    $if env::COMPILER_SAFE_MODE:
        always_assert(#cond, $msg);
    $endif
}
```

Two corrections from the code. It is **not** `@private`: C3's `@private` does  
not reach a submodule, so `mtk::helper` could not see it — and Part 17.2 makes  
that right anyway, since an application writing its own Slot-shaped call is  
entitled to the same check (F3). And the message is a **compile-time** string,  
because `always_assert` takes one (F5). The clause is carried to the abort  
intact:

```
ERROR: 'Violated assert '#cond': Part 8.6 walk: the item is already on this list'
```

In a safe build it is `always_assert`, which aborts and names the message. In  
`--safe=no` it expands to nothing — the condition is not evaluated, and nothing  
is handed to the optimizer as a promise. That is ztk's model, restored, on a  
language whose `assert` does not provide it.

**The rule that follows, and it binds every call site:** *an expression passed  
to `mtk::@check` must have no required side effect.* It may not mutate state,  
allocate, release, perform I/O, or do anything the program needs done. `@check`  
is observational, and

```c3
mtk::@check(self.drain(), "...");     // WRONG: drains in a safe build only
```

is a program that behaves differently in the two build families — the exact  
class of bug the three tiers exist to prevent, reintroduced by the mechanism  
meant to prevent it. Tier 3's `$if` blocks carry the same rule for the same  
reason, one level up: the block is not compiled at all in a fast build.

`NodeList.contains` is the port's one interesting case. It is a real function  
with a real O(n) cost and no side effect, which is exactly why it is legal  
inside a tier 3 block.

The site list:

| Site | Spec | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| Releasing an open mailbox or pool | 11.12 MUST | **1** |
| Overwriting a full Slot | 9.2 rule 3 | 2 |
| Inserting an item that already has neighbours | 8.6 link test | 2 |
| Inserting an item already on this list | 8.6 walk | **3** |
| Moving a list onto itself | 8.9 | 2, **plus the early return** |
| A hook returning an item of the wrong identity | 12.2 | 2 |
| An asserting crossing on a mismatch | 6.3 | 2 |

Part 8.9's pair is not softened: the assert is tier 2 and compiles out, and the  
early return is ordinary code and does not. The specification says exactly this,  
and it is the one place where the port keeps both.

Every *runtime condition* — closed, timeout, nothing available — is a fault and  
never an assert, in every build mode. Part 15.5, and D15.

## D7 — The timed wait

**Ruling: `wait_timeout` does not appear in the port.** Closer to a finding  
than a decision, and 3TK-7 proved it by sabotage — see the note at the end of  
this section.

Q7 read the stdlib: `wait_timeout` computes `time::now() + ms` on **every  
call**. A retry loop built on it restarts the full timeout at every spurious  
wakeup, without bound. That is precisely Part 2.5 MUST and invariant 4, and it  
fails silently — the call simply never times out under load.

The one shape, written once and used at every waiting site:

```c3
Time deadline = time::now() + timeout;        // anchored once, before the loop
while (true)
{
    // re-evaluate the state from scratch — Part 2.4
    if (...) { ...; return; }
    if (self._closed) return CLOSED?;
    if (catch f = self._cond.wait_until(&self._mu, deadline))
    {
        if (f == thread::WAIT_TIMEOUT)
        {
            // Part 2.6: the leaver checks the container and signals
            if (!self._queue.is_empty()) self._cond.signal();
            return TIMEOUT?;
        }
        return f?;
    }
}
```

Four MUSTs are in those lines and the port writes them once: 2.4 the re-check,  
2.5 the anchor, 2.6 the hand-off, 15.3 the flag read under the mutex.

`3tk-poc.md` row P7 is the draft that got this wrong. It is the only draft that  
touched the code path.

**Proved by sabotage, 3TK-7.** The trouble with this MUST is that a wrong  
implementation passes every ordinary timeout test. `wait_until(deadline)` was  
swapped for `wait_timeout(timeout)` in `Mailbox.receive` and the suite reported  
`FAILED: 70 passed, 1 failed`, naming Part 2.5. The sabotage was reverted. A  
test for an invariant of this shape is worth nothing until it has been seen to  
fail.

## D8 — The names

**Ruling.**

| Thing | Name | Why |
|---|---|---|
| The module root | `mtk` | `any` is a reserved keyword (Q4/C3). `matryoshka` as a path prefix on every line is noise |
| The inner | `AnyNode` | C11. `polynode` is the ztk name and this is not a transliteration |
| A handle | `AnyHandle` | Part 10.1. A transparent alias, and it is the reading aid |
| The Slot | `Slot` | Part 9. Distinct type, D5 |
| The list | **`NodeList`** | **Not `AnyList`.** `std::collections::anylist` exists, is heterogeneous, and **shallow-copies and owns every element** — the semantic opposite, under the name every draft chose |
| The per-type helper | `mtk::helper <Type>` | A generic module, not a macro. Q1 corrected `3tk-polyhelper.md` |
| The owning variant | `mtk::owned <Type>` | D10, D3 |
| The containers | `Mailbox`, `Pool` | Unchanged |
| The hooks | `PoolHooks` | An interface. Q5 |

Two hazards Q1 found, carried as rules: **a struct name that is all uppercase  
does not compile**, and `Any` is available as a *type* name but unusable as a  
*module* name.

`C3` — the review's third conflict — is closed by that pair: `3tk-porting-notes.md`  
was right that `Any` works as a type, `3tk-additions.md` was right about the  
keyword and wrong about what follows from it.

`C11` is closed for the type names here, and for the file names by section 1.

## D9 — Interruption is dropped

**Ruling: Part 2.9 is not implemented.**

Part 2.9 is a SHOULD whose own text says: *on a port with no such mechanism,  
this outcome is dropped and the timeout outcome stays*. Q7 measured C3: there is  
no interruptible condition wait. `INTERRUPTED` exists for `sleep` and for  
`TimedMutex.lock_timeout` on `EINTR`, and nowhere else.

Building it — a per-waiter flag plus a broadcast — is possible and is not free:  
it is a field per waiter, a second reason to wake, and a second cause to keep  
distinct from closed at every wait site. Part 2.10 then applies as well, and  
every give-back path has to be proved uninterruptible.

The port drops it, and the outcome sets of Part 19 lose exactly one value in  
two rows: `receive` and `get with waiting`. Nothing else changes. Part 16 rows  
11 and 12 were already going.

*If the owner overrides:* Part 11.5's counter mechanism is the model to copy —  
a counter, captured before the wait, compared after every wakeup — and Part  
2.10 becomes a review item for every path in `pool.c3`.

## D10 — Two generic modules

**Ruling: `mtk::helper <Type>` and `mtk::owned <Type>`.**

Part 7.3's distinction is real and portable: not every type wants create and  
release. ztk spells it with a marker constant and a branching generator, and  
pays 110 duplicated lines. Q1 found there is no `has_tag` property to branch  
on in C3 anyway.

Two modules, with `owned` composing `helper` rather than copying it:

```c3
module mtk::owned <Type>;
import mtk;

alias h = mtk::helper{Type};      // Part 7.2's surface, once
fn void create(Allocator a, Slot* slot)  { ... }
fn void release(Slot* slot)              { ... }
```

An application writes one alias for a plain type and one for an owning type,  
and the two spell the same surface. No duplication, no marker constant, no  
branch.

## D11 — The order

**Ruling: Part 22 as written. The list is step 5.**

C8 records two true reasons pointing opposite ways. Part 22's reason wins on a  
mechanical point: the list *speaks in handles* (Part 8.3) and two of its  
operations *take Slots* (Part 8.2). It cannot be written, let alone tested,  
before `AnyHandle` and `Slot` exist.

The drafts' reason — that both containers depend on the list — is satisfied  
anyway, since the list is step 5 and the containers are 6 and 7.

One amendment from Q1: **the helper needs no prototyping step of its own.** It  
was prototyped in 3TK-4, for two outer types, with the whole of Part 7.2  
exercised. Step 3 starts from working code.

## D12 to D16, briefly

**D12 — the link test's blind spot is accepted.** Part 8.7 prices the  
alternative at a field per item, and D3 already refused **an additional  
per-item allocator field** in the inner for a stronger reason. (003 said "a  
third field" here; the inner already has three. What Part 4.2 guards is a  
*further* per-item field of any kind, not the number three. Section 1.) The blind spot is documented at the link test and  
in `NodeList`'s header comment, as Part 8.7 requires. The walk of Part 8.6 is  
what covers it in checking builds.

**D13 — both a receive and a poll.** Part 20 decision 5 notes a zero-timeout  
receive has the same reach. The two are kept apart because they report the  
empty case differently — `poll` reports `EMPTY`, a receive at a zero deadline  
reports `TIMEOUT` — and Part 19.1 lists both. One is not a special case of the  
other to a caller reading outcomes.

**D14 — out-of-band is kept**, one level, not a queue, with the anchor at the  
last out-of-band item so the insert stays O(1) and the anchor cleared when that  
item is taken. Part 11.3, invariant 22.

**D15 — outcomes are C3 faults.** `faultdef CLOSED, TIMEOUT, NOT_AVAILABLE,  
NOT_CREATED, EMPTY, WOKEN;`, returned as `void?` or `Type?`. It is what the  
stdlib does — `thread::WAIT_TIMEOUT` is a fault (Q7) — and `if (catch f = ...)`  
is the language's own reading shape. Part 19's set is fixed; this is the  
spelling. Note that these are *runtime conditions*, never defects: D6 keeps  
them out of the assert tiers entirely.

**D16 — the pre-lock fast path is kept**, as `Atomic{bool}`, with the  
acquire-outside / relaxed-inside / release-on-store ordering Part 15.4  
specifies, and with the re-read under the lock. Part 15.4's prohibition is  
respected literally: the port may not drop the re-check while keeping the fast  
read. Q10 verified the orderings exist with contracts rejecting invalid  
combinations.

# 3. What C3 deletes

Measured, not estimated.

| Deleted | Was | Why |
|---|---|---|
| The whole of Part 16, rows 1 to 11 | ztk's `std.Io` surface | The port is on plain threads. Part 16's own preamble |
| **Row 7 alone: 71 lines** | The hand-written timed condition wait | `ConditionVariable.wait_until` exists, on an absolute deadline. Q7 |
| Row 12 | The interruptible error in two signatures | D9 |
| The per-type mutable byte, and the linker-merging defence | Part 5.3's ztk realization | `typeid` is native and two identically-shaped types differ. Q2 |
| The `ctx` field on the hook struct | Part 12.1's ztk realization | The implementing object is the context. Q5 |
| 110 duplicated lines in the generator | Part 7.3's ztk realization | D10, two composing modules |
| Runtime validation of the outer type | Part 7.4's fallback | `$assert` over `$Type::members`, at build time, naming the type. Q12 |
| Hand-written cleanup at every exit | Part 9.7's fallback | `defer`. Q6 |
| The allocator parameter on both release calls | Part 13.3's ztk mismatch | D3, Q8 |

And one thing C3 *adds* that ztk cannot have: Part 6.5's dispatch may be a  
`switch` on `typeid`, because a `typeid` is a compile-time-known constant and a  
ztk tag is a linker-assigned address. Q2 verified it compiles. The port  
provides the table — handlers registered at runtime is the general case — and  
documents the `switch` as available where the handler set is fixed.

Not deleted, and deliberately: Part 8.1's list. `std::collections::linkedlist`  
allocates a node per element, and `anylist` copies. Neither is intrusive. Part  
8.5 required the port to write the checking layer regardless.

---

# 4. What the port pays

Four costs, from Q4 through Q11, all knowing.

1. **No private fields.** D1. Part 11.11 is skipped with the reason written
   down.
2. **No interruptible wait.** D9. Part 2.9 is dropped, as its own text allows.
3. **`assert` under `--safe=no -O3` is an assumption, not a removed check.**
   D6 routes around it and no plain `assert` guards a contract in the port.
4. **No intrusive list in the stdlib.** The port writes `NodeList`. It was
   going to anyway — Part 8.5.

---

# 5. The mapping — every MUST and SHOULD

Part by part. The specification's marking, and the C3 shape.

MAY elements are in section 6. EXCLUDED elements are in section 3.

## 5.1 Parts 1 to 3 — the frame

| Spec | Marking | C3 shape |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1 What it is | MUST | The design, unchanged. `mtk` ships no thread and no queue type of its own |
| 1.2 What it is not | MUST | No `Future`, no select, no event loop. `3tk-poc.md` P1 and `3tk-build-dist.md` B3 both proposed a fourth layer; refused |
| 1.3 No `Master` type | MUST | Not written. Named in the docs as the application's |
| 2.1 Plain threads | MUST | `std::thread::Thread`. The toolkit starts none |
| 2.2 Two primitives | MUST | `Mutex` and `ConditionVariable`. *Read* `threads/thread.c3:11-17` |
| 2.3 Timeout is the primitive | MUST | Every waiting call takes a `Duration`; the poll takes none |
| 2.4 A wakeup carries no meaning | MUST | The `while(true)` of D7. No wakeup short-circuits |
| 2.5 The deadline is anchored once | MUST | D7. `wait_until` on a `Time` computed before the loop |
| 2.6 Signal hand-off on a lost race | MUST | D7's timeout arm, and the same three lines on the closed arm |
| 2.7 Many producers, many consumers | MUST | Falls out of the mutex. Nothing per-thread is kept |
| 2.8 Order among receivers undefined | MUST | Documented. `signal` picks; the port does not promise fairness |
| 2.9 Interruption | SHOULD | **Dropped. D9** |
| 2.10 Cleanup paths run to the end | MUST where 2.9 | Not applicable **as an interruption-specific requirement**, because D9 drops interruption. The ordinary give-back and cleanup paths stay non-failing where Parts 9, 11 and 19 require it: `Pool.put` cannot fail, `close` cannot fail, and no release path has an outcome |
| 3.1 Long-lived heap objects | MUST | `alloc::new(a, Type)`. Documented as a precondition of every participant |
| 3.2 The address is fixed | MUST | Documented. C3 does not move a heap allocation |
| 3.3 Items versus participants | SHOULD | Documented. A short-lived item is legal; a participant is not |

## 5.2 Parts 4 and 5 — the inner and the identity

| Spec | Marking | C3 shape |
|---|---|---|
| 4.1 The outer embeds the inner | MUST | `AnyNode node;` as a field. **D2**, no `inline` |
| 4.2 Two parts, nothing more | MUST | `prev`, `next`, `type`. **Two conceptual parts, three fields** — section 1. **D3 refuses an additional per-item allocator responsibility**, which is the test Part 4.2 sets. 24 bytes on linux-x64, measured, not required |
| 4.3 The field may sit anywhere | SHOULD | `$Type::members` gives `.offset`; the crossing subtracts it. Q3, verified at offset 8 |
| 4.4 One inner per outer | MUST | `$assert` in the helper: exactly one `AnyNode` field, not zero and not two |
| 5.1 A per-type identity | MUST | `Type::typeid`. Every clause measured. Q2 |
| 5.2 What it is not | MUST | Falls out. A `typeid` is not per-item, not a string, not an index |
| 5.3 Spelling is free | SHOULD | Native identifier taken. The address trick and the mutable byte are deleted |
| 5.4 Stored, not computed | MUST | `AnyNode.type`, written by the initializer, read by the walker |
| 5.5 The uninitialized identity | SHOULD | `mtk::helper::init` writes it, and `owned::create` calls `init`. A stack item still needs `init` called, and the doc says so |

Part 5.5 is the one place C3 gives no more than Zig: there is no required  
constructor. The mitigation is that a zeroed `typeid` matches no type, so the  
first crossing refuses rather than mis-claiming.

## 5.3 Parts 6 and 7 — the crossings and the helper

| Spec | Marking | C3 shape |
|---|---|---|
| 6.1 Self-identification | MUST | `h.type == Type::typeid` |
| 6.2 Three places, no others | MUST | The helper's crossings, and `NodeList`'s walk in the application's hands |
| 6.3 Two forms | MUST | `from_any` returns `Type*` or null; `must_from_any` is tier 2 of D6 then the cast |
| 6.4 What it makes safe | background | — |
| 6.5 Dispatch on the identity | SHOULD | A table keyed on `typeid`. A miss leaves the item in its Slot and returns. **`switch` over `Type::typeid` also compiles** — Q2, and ztk cannot |
| 7.1 A per-type helper | SHOULD | `module mtk::helper <Type>;`, one `alias` per outer type. Q1, verified for two types |
| 7.2 The helper's surface | MUST | Seven clauses, nine members. Table below |
| 7.3 Create and release | SHOULD | **D10**, `mtk::owned <Type>` |
| 7.4 Validation of the type | SHOULD | `$assert` over `$Type::members`, at build time, and **the message names the type**. Q12, verified |
| 7.5 The border, named once | MUST | **D2 and D4 both exist to protect this.** All arithmetic is in `helper.c3` |

**Part 7.2's seven clauses are nine members.** Two of its bullets each name a  
pair — *checking and asserting* crossings from a handle, and the same pair from  
a Slot — so the required surface is seven clauses wide and nine functions deep.  
The port adds nothing to it and omits nothing from it. All nine were compiled  
and exercised in 3TK-4.

| Member | Signature | Part 7.2 clause |
|---|---|---|
| The identity | `const typeid TYPE = Type::typeid;` | 1 — the identity value |
| The predicate | `fn bool is_mine(AnyHandle h)` | 2 — the predicate |
| Checking crossing, handle | `fn Type* from_any(AnyHandle h)` | 3 — the pair, checking half |
| Asserting crossing, handle | `fn Type* must_from_any(AnyHandle h)` | 3 — the pair, asserting half |
| Checking crossing, Slot | `fn Type* from_slot(Slot* s)` | 4 — the pair, checking half |
| Asserting crossing, Slot | `fn Type* must_from_slot(Slot* s)` | 4 — the pair, asserting half |
| **Moving** crossing, Slot | `fn Type* move_from_slot(Slot* s)` | 5 — the moving crossing |
| The way back | `fn AnyHandle to_any(Type* item)` | 6 — the way back, cannot fail |
| The initializer | `fn void init(Type* item)` | 7 — the initializer |

One more member exists and is not on the list: `const usz OFF`, the offset of  
the inner in the outer. It is the arithmetic itself rather than a member Part  
7.2 asks for, and Part 7.4's build-time validation runs inside the macro that  
computes it.

**Why `TYPE` exists** when `Type::typeid` is available at every call site: it is  
the helper's stable spelling of the identity, so that a call site says  
`msg::TYPE` and not `Msg::typeid`, and reflection syntax stays inside the  
border along with the arithmetic. It also gives the containers something to  
name — `pool::TYPE`, `mailbox::TYPE` — without either of them naming a  
reflection operator. It is a `const`, so it costs nothing at runtime.

The moving crossing is the one with two postconditions, and 3TK-4 verified  
both: on a match the pointer is returned **and** the Slot is cleared; on a  
mismatch nothing is returned **and the Slot is untouched** — Part 9.2 rule 4.

## 5.4 Part 8 — the list

| Spec | Marking | C3 shape |
|---|---|---|
| 8.1 Intrusive, heterogeneous, O(1), no allocation | MUST | `NodeList`, written by the port. The stdlib has nothing intrusive |
| 8.2 The surface | SHOULD | Sixteen operations, section 5.5. None can fail |
| 8.2 The count | SHOULD | `len` is O(1), from a kept `count` field. The invariant is in section 5.5 |
| 8.3 The list speaks in handles | MUST | Every entry point takes `AnyHandle` or `Slot*`. Never `Type*` |
| 8.4 The walk | SHOULD | `NodeListIterator`, taken from the list, yielding handles. Removal during a walk is not supported, and the doc says so |
| 8.5 The checks live here | MUST | `NodeList` is the layer. There is no raw primitive under it |
| 8.6 The double check | SHOULD | The link test is **tier 2** of D6. The walk is **tier 3**, a `$if env::COMPILER_SAFE_MODE` block, so the O(n) is not merely compiled out but never compiled |
| 8.7 The link test's blind spot | MUST | Documented at the function and in the header. **D12** |
| 8.8 The repair | MUST | Every removal clears `prev` and `next`. One `@private` helper, called from all of them |
| 8.9 Moving a list onto itself | SHOULD | The pair: a tier-2 check **and** an early return. The return is not compiled out |
| 8.10 Bridging to the language's own list | MAY | **Dropped.** Section 6 |
| 8.11 Test access to the raw list | MAY | **Dropped.** Section 6 |

## 5.5 The `NodeList` surface — Part 8.2

Names are the port's business; these are the port's.

| Operation | Signature |
|---|---|
| Take from the front | `fn AnyHandle pop_front(&self)` |
| Take from the back | `fn AnyHandle pop_back(&self)` |
| Remove a named item | `fn void remove(&self, AnyHandle h)` |
| Look at the front | `fn AnyHandle front(&self)` |
| Look at the back | `fn AnyHandle back(&self)` |
| Add at the back | `fn void push_back(&self, AnyHandle h)` |
| Add at the front | `fn void push_front(&self, AnyHandle h)` |
| Add at the back from a Slot | `fn void push_back_slot(&self, Slot* s)` |
| Add at the front from a Slot | `fn void push_front_slot(&self, Slot* s)` |
| Insert after | `fn void insert_after(&self, AnyHandle at, AnyHandle h)` |
| Insert before | `fn void insert_before(&self, AnyHandle at, AnyHandle h)` |
| Is it empty | `fn bool is_empty(&self)` |
| How many | `fn usz len(&self)` |
| Walk it | `fn NodeListIterator iter(&self)` |
| Move another list onto this one | `fn void append_list(&self, NodeList* other)` |
| Is it on this list | `fn bool NodeList.contains(&self, AnyHandle h)` |

Sixteen, counted. `contains` is the sixteenth and 002 left it off the table  
while claiming the total — it is the O(n) walk of Part 8.6, public because a  
tier 3 block in `list.c3` calls it and because Part 8.7's blind spot leaves an  
application no other way to ask the question.

`pop_front`, `pop_back`, `front` and `back` return a null handle on an empty  
list. That is Part 8.2's *both may find the list empty*, and it is not a fault —  
Part 19.4, no operation on the list can fail.

**The count invariant.** `len` is O(1) because the list keeps a `count` field,  
and that field is state, which means it can be wrong in ways the link  
invariants would not catch:

- `NodeList.count` equals the number of items currently linked into the list.
- Every insertion increments it exactly once. Every removal decrements it
  exactly once.
- `append_list` transfers both counts and leaves the source at zero.
- `is_empty` and `len` both read it, so the two can never disagree.

The field is `count`; `len()` is the operation Part 8.2 names. Keeping it is  
what lets Part 11.7 hand a per-identity number to a hook without a walk —  
`PoolBucket` therefore keeps no count of its own, and Part 11.7 asks for one  
only where the list's length is not O(1).

`append_list` carries Part 8.9's pair.

## 5.6 Part 9 — the Slot

| Spec | Marking | C3 shape |
|---|---|---|
| 9.1 A container of one handle, or nothing | MUST | `typedef Slot = AnyHandle`. **D5** |
| 9.2 The six rules | MUST | Table below |
| 9.3 The signature shape | MUST | Every acquiring operation takes `Slot*` and returns `void?`. The item is never returned |
| 9.4 The Slot is the answer | MUST | Documented at `Pool.put`, at the dispatch table, and at every transfer |
| 9.5 The one exception | MAY | **Dropped.** No select mechanism. Section 6 |
| 9.6 One place at a time | MUST | The invariant the whole file protects |
| 9.7 Cleanup before acquisition | SHOULD | `defer` on the line **before** the acquisition. Q6 |
| 9.8 Creation is an acquisition | SHOULD | `owned::create(a, &slot)`. No pointer returned |
| 9.9 The Slot's own type | MAY | **Taken.** D5, distinct |

The six rules, and where each is enforced:

| # | Rule | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Never overwrite a full Slot | Tier 2 check at every acquiring entry point. D5 makes the two-star confusion untypeable |
| 2 | A Slot starts empty | Zero-initialization. A `Slot` is null by default |
| 3 | An acquisition asserts the Slot is empty on entry | Tier 2, first line of every acquiring function |
| 4 | A failing acquisition leaves the Slot unchanged | Every fault path returns before the write. Verified for `move_from_slot` in 3TK-4 |
| 5 | A transfer clears the Slot | The write to null is in the same block as the link-in |
| 6 | A release is a no-op on an empty Slot | `if (!*s) return;` — which is what makes 9.7 legal |

Part 9.7's shape, in C3:

```c3
Slot slot;                                  // rule 2: empty
defer msg::release(&slot);                  // registered BEFORE the acquisition
if (catch f = pool.get(Msg::typeid, &slot)) return f?;
Msg* m = msg::must_from_slot(&slot);
...
```

Rule 6 is what makes the `defer` safe on the path where `get` failed and the  
Slot was never filled.

## 5.7 Part 10 — the synonyms

| Spec | Marking | C3 shape |
|---|---|---|
| 10.1 Four names kept apart | SHOULD | `AnyNode` the inner, `AnyHandle` the handle, `Slot` the Slot, the outer's own name the item. **D2 exists to stop `inline` collapsing two of them** |
| 10.2 Why not collapsed | background | In this port the compiler learns something after all: `Slot` is distinct. D5 |
| 10.3 The word "object" | SHOULD | Prose rule, carried into the port's docs |

## 5.8 Part 11.1 to 11.6 — the mailbox

| Spec | Marking | C3 shape |
|---|---|---|
| 11.1 The containers are items | MUST | `struct Mailbox { AnyNode node; ... }`, with `alias mbox = mtk::helper{Mailbox};`. **D1 is what keeps this literal** |
| 11.2 One internal base | SHOULD | Not a public type. The five members are repeated in both structs, `@private` functions shared |
| 11.3 The mailbox | MUST | Seven operations, section 5.10 |
| 11.4 Out-of-band is one level | MAY | **Kept. D14** |
| 11.5 Waking every waiter | SHOULD | A `usz _wake_gen` counter, captured before the wait, compared after every wakeup, with `broadcast`. Q7 confirmed `broadcast` exists |
| 11.6 The give-back rule | MUST | Every path returns items to a caller. The doc names the mistake: discarding the list `close` returns drops items that keep their links, and a later send then refuses them |
| 11.6 A closed mailbox is empty | MUST | Invariant 34. `close` drains the queue in one step under the mutex, and `send` re-checks the flag under that same mutex. Tested by `a_closed_mailbox_is_empty` |

**There is no closed-versus-available precedence rule, because there is no such  
choice.** Invariant 34 of the specification — added in 002, on this port's  
evidence — makes a closed mailbox empty: `close` takes the whole queue in one  
step under the mutex, and a send after the flag is set is refused under that  
same mutex, so no item can be sitting in a closed mailbox. A `receive`, a `poll`  
or a `receive_all` on a closed mailbox therefore reports `CLOSED` on an empty  
queue, and never has to decide between an item and the closed state.

A reader who takes Part 19.1's outcome rows as a priority list — item *or*  
closed, when both look applicable — has invented a state this design does not  
have. The port's `close` is the only drain, and it hands everything to the  
caller. The pool is the same shape, with the hook in the caller's place.

## 5.9 Part 11.7 to 11.12 and Part 12 — the pool

| Spec | Marking | C3 shape |
|---|---|---|
| 11.7 The pool | MUST | One `NodeList` per identity, in a flat `PoolBucket[]`. Construction rules below. **G4:** a hash map buys nothing for a set that is fixed and small; the linear scan is faster and allocates once |
| 11.8 The give-back rule, pool side | MUST | `close` passes everything to the hook and returns nothing. A closed pool leaves the Slot unchanged. A list put stops at the first refusal and pushes that item back at the **front** of the caller's list |
| 11.8 A closed pool is empty | MUST | Invariant 34, pool side. Every bucket is collected in one step under the mutex and a put after the flag is refused. Tested by `a_closed_pool_is_empty` |
| 11.9 Waiting get never creates | MUST | `get_wait` invokes no hook on any path. Where a plain get in `AVAILABLE_ONLY` reports `NOT_AVAILABLE`, this reports `TIMEOUT`, and Part 11.9 calls the divergence deliberate. See the note below on the conflicting source |
| 11.10 No sequence guarantee | MUST | Documented. Nothing promised about which item returns |
| 11.11 Hidden implementation | SHOULD | **Skipped. D1**, with the reason written down |
| 11.12 Close before release | MUST | **`always_assert`. Tier 1 of D6.** The one call that aborts in every build mode. Close is idempotent and the second call does not re-run the hook. The test-and-set is inside the mutex |
| 12.1 Hooks as an interface | MUST | `interface PoolHooks`, a creation parameter. Q5, verified. **`ctx` is deleted** |
| 12.2 The three hooks | MUST | Signatures below |
| 12.3 Hook concurrency | MUST | Unlock, call, relock. Documented: hooks run in parallel, protect their own state, and do not call back |
| 12.4 The count is a hint | MUST | Passed by value, read under the lock, documented as stale. After removal on get, before addition on put |
| 12.5 The extra list on put | SHOULD | A second `NodeList*` parameter on `on_put`. Each item added the same way, with the same checks |

**The bucket set, in full.** G4 chose the representation; these are the rules  
that make it a design rather than a performance note:

- The set is fixed at `pool::create` and never changes. No bucket is added or
  removed for the life of the pool.
- Each configured identity appears **exactly once**. Creation refuses an empty
  set, and refuses a duplicate.
- A duplicate has to be refused rather than tolerated, because `bucket_for`
  returns the *first* match: a second bucket for an identity that already has  
  one can never be found, so every put lands in the first and the second stays  
  empty forever. Nothing fails and nothing is reported — the pool quietly holds  
  half of what its creator asked for. It is a tier 2 check, since the identity  
  set is the caller's to get right.
- Lookup is a linear scan of the fixed array, and it happens **under the pool
  mutex**, as does every mutation of a bucket's list.
- An identity the pool was not created with is likewise a caller defect: tier 2,
  and `NOT_AVAILABLE` in a fast build, which is the truthful answer.
- The only pool work outside the mutex is the hook call, and by then the state
  the hook needs has been detached from the buckets.

**A note on Part 11.9 and its conflicting sources.** ztk's book states twice  
that the waiting get calls the creation hook. ztk's code does not call it. The  
specification follows the code, Part 11.9, and so does this port. The rule the  
port applies when sources disagree is worth stating once, because it will come  
up again: **the running code is the evidence, the specification is the  
authority, and prose that contradicts both is superseded.** The ztk book still  
needs the fix, and that is a job for the ztk line rather than this one —  
`ztk-audit-001.md` section 5.2.

The three hooks, as the specification requires them and as Q5 compiled them —  
**not** as `3tk-additions.md` proposed:

```c3
interface PoolHooks
{
    fn void on_get(typeid want, usz in_pool, Slot* slot);
    fn void on_put(usz in_pool, Slot* slot, NodeList* extra);
    fn void on_close(NodeList* remaining);
}
```

- `on_get` gets an empty Slot and the wanted identity. Leaving it empty is the
  `NOT_CREATED` outcome. Returning an item of another identity is a defect —  
  tier 2.
- `on_put` gets a Slot carrying all four of Part 12.2's outcomes: emptied means
  released, full means kept, full with a different item means replaced.
- **G5: that is not the caller's Slot.** `Pool.put` clears the caller's Slot at
  the moment it accepts the item — Part 9.4, cleared means kept — and then hands  
  the hook a Slot of its own. A port that passes the caller's through lets a  
  hook that *keeps* the item leave the caller's Slot full, which reads as  
  *refused*.

**`Pool.put` has two Slot domains, and the order between them is the contract.**  
The caller reads its own Slot to learn what happened, so the moment the pool  
commits has to be fixed and has to be before the hook can influence it:

1. The caller's Slot is checked, and holds the offered item. An empty one is a
   no-op.
2. Under the mutex, the pool decides whether it accepts — closed, or an
   identity it was not created with, are the two refusals, and both return with  
   the caller's Slot **untouched**.
3. **The commit.** The item is taken out of the caller's Slot, and from this
   line on the caller's Slot is empty and the pool owns the item.
4. A hook-local Slot is filled with it. A hook-local `extra` list is empty.
5. The mutex is released — Part 12.3, no lock across application code.
6. `on_put` runs on the hook-local Slot, and may empty it, leave it, or replace
   its contents. Part 12.2's four outcomes.
7. The mutex is retaken. A full hook-local Slot means an item is kept and it
   goes to its bucket; every item on `extra` is added the same way, with the  
   same checks — Part 12.5.

**After step 3 the caller's Slot stays empty whatever the hook does.** That is  
the invariant, and it is the reason the two Slots exist: *the caller's  
observable result does not depend on the hook's decision.* The pool accepted the  
item; what policy then does with it is between the pool and its hooks. A hook  
that releases the item does not thereby hand it back to the caller, because the  
caller no longer has it.
- `on_close` gets the list of what remained, is called **once**, **outside the
  mutex**, **after the flag is set**, and owns every item in it.

## 5.10 The container surfaces — Part 11.3, 11.7, and Part 19

`Mailbox`, in `mtk::mailbox`. Created with `mailbox::create(a)`:

| Operation | Signature | Outcomes |
|---|---|---|
| send | `fn void? send(&self, Slot* s)` | done; `CLOSED`, Slot unchanged |
| send out-of-band | `fn void? send_oob(&self, Slot* s)` | as send |
| receive | `fn void? receive(&self, Slot* s, Duration t)` | item; `CLOSED`; `TIMEOUT`; `WOKEN` |
| poll | `fn void? poll(&self, Slot* s)` | item; `EMPTY`; `CLOSED` |
| receive the batch | `fn void? receive_all(&self, NodeList* out)` | a list, possibly empty; `CLOSED` |
| close | `fn void close(&self, NodeList* out)` | a list. Cannot fail |
| wake every waiter | `fn void? wake_all(&self)` | done; `CLOSED` — see below |
| release | `fn void release(&self)` | **Tier 1 assert if open.** No allocator parameter |

**Why `wake_all` reports `CLOSED`.** It is the outcome Part 19.1 gives it —  
*wake every waiter: done; closed* — and the port does not narrow a specified  
outcome set. The reason behind the specification's choice is that `wake_all` is  
defined as acting on an **open** mailbox: it bumps the wake generation and  
broadcasts, which is a state change, and Part 11.5 says the mailbox stays open  
afterwards. On a closed mailbox there is nothing to wake — `close` broadcast  
already — so the call has no work to do and says so. Reporting success would  
claim a wake that did not happen.

`Pool`, in `mtk::pool`. Created with `pool::create(a, tags, hooks)`:

| Operation | Signature | Outcomes |
|---|---|---|
| get | `fn void? get(&self, typeid want, GetMode m, Slot* s)` | item; `CLOSED`; `NOT_AVAILABLE`; `NOT_CREATED` |
| get with waiting | `fn void? get_wait(&self, typeid want, Slot* s, Duration t)` | item; `CLOSED`; `TIMEOUT` |
| put | `fn void put(&self, Slot* s)` | Nothing. **Read the Slot** |
| put a list | `fn void put_all(&self, NodeList* items)` | Nothing. **Read the list** |
| close | `fn void close(&self)` | Nothing. Cannot fail |
| release | `fn void release(&self)` | **Tier 1 assert if open.** No allocator parameter |

`enum GetMode { AVAILABLE_OR_NEW, NEW_ONLY, AVAILABLE_ONLY }`.

The faults are `mtk::CLOSED`, `mtk::TIMEOUT`, `mtk::EMPTY`, `mtk::WOKEN`,  
`mtk::NOT_AVAILABLE`, `mtk::NOT_CREATED`. The return spelling is `~` and not  
`?` — `return mtk::CLOSED~;` — because `?` marks the optional type. G2.

Part 19.3's asymmetry, kept: `NOT_AVAILABLE` comes only from `AVAILABLE_ONLY`,  
`NOT_CREATED` only from a hook that produced nothing, and `get_wait` reports  
`TIMEOUT` where `AVAILABLE_ONLY` would report `NOT_AVAILABLE`.

`put` and `put_all` return `void`, not `void?`. Part 19.2 — put cannot fail —  
and Part 9.4 — the Slot is the answer, not the outcome. This is the shape the  
whole idiom exists for, and the port does not soften it into a fault.

## 5.11 Parts 13 to 15

| Spec | Marking | C3 shape |
|---|---|---|
| 13.1 An allocator kept for life | SHOULD | **D3.** `alloc::free(self.alloc, self)`, no parameter. Q8, verified |
| 13.4 Application items | open | **D3 part 3.** Per type, by which helper it takes |
| 13.5 No explicit allocator | SHOULD | Does not apply. C3 parameterizes allocation |
| 14.1 One holder at a time | MUST | The Slot idiom is how it is spelled. D5 helps the compiler help |
| 14.2 The transfer orders memory | MUST | Both containers publish through their own mutex. Items are read with plain loads. Documented, because it is invisible in the signatures |
| 14.3 The transfer circuit | SHOULD | Carried into the port's docs as the diagram it is |
| 15.1 One mutex per container | MUST | `Mutex _mu`, covering that object's state only. No application data under it |
| 15.2 No lock across application code | MUST | The unlock-call-relock of 12.3. **No current toolkit path holds one container mutex while acquiring another**, so the toolkit has no inter-container lock order. Stated as a property of the code today, not as a timeless one: it holds while hooks run outside the lock and no operation coordinates a Mailbox and a Pool. Section 6.6 |
| 15.3 The closed flag | MUST | Read and set under the mutex. Setting it is the whole of close's state change |
| 15.4 The pre-lock check | SHOULD | **D16.** `Atomic{bool}`, acquire outside, relaxed inside, release on the store, **and the re-read under the lock** |
| 15.5 Asserts versus outcomes | SHOULD | **D6.** Three tiers, and every runtime condition is a fault |

## 5.12 Part 17 — the layering

| Spec | Marking | C3 shape |
|---|---|---|
| 17.1 One tool is required | MUST | `any.c3`, `helper.c3`, `owned.c3`, `list.c3`. Usable with neither container |
| 17.2 Two are optional | SHOULD | `mailbox.c3` and `pool.c3` import `mtk` and use only public entry points |

17.2's second clause is two claims with two different kinds of proof, and 002  
ran them together:

| Claim | Held by |
|---|---|
| The containers cannot call a `@private` declaration of the core | **The compiler.** They are submodules; the declarations are not in scope. Nothing to test |
| The containers do not reach around the core's public surface | **A source check**, because D1 made the fields public. A convention, and the script enforces it by name |

The source check is narrow on purpose, and naming what it forbids is the only  
way it means anything: it rejects any reference in `mailbox.c3` or `pool.c3` to  
`unlink_no_repair` or `@guard_insert` — the two `NodeList` internals that would  
let a container relink an item without the checks of Part 8.6 and the repair of  
Part 8.8. "Reads a field" as a blanket rule would be useless, since the  
containers necessarily read public values through the surface all day.

What the two together establish is Part 17.2's real claim: **every crossing the  
containers perform is one an application could write.** Section 7 runs both.

---

# 6. The implementation invariants

Six rules the port already obeys and no document stated. They are here because  
an unstated invariant is one refactor away from being lost: every one of them  
looks like an inefficiency or an oversight to a reader who does not know why it  
is there, and each would be easy to "improve" into a defect.

They came out of `3tk-porting-proposal-003-review.md`, which asked for most of  
them as changes. Read against `3tk/src/`, five were already true. Writing them  
down is the whole of the work, and it is the most durable thing in this  
revision.

## 6.1 The pre-lock atomic is a hint, never an authorization

D16's fast read may **reject** work early. It may never **permit** a mutation.

```
outside the lock   the atomic may refuse the call
inside the lock    the mutex-protected state is authoritative, always
```

No path may do `if (!closed_fast) { mutate }`. Every caller that reads `false`  
re-reads `_closed` under the mutex, because close may fire between the two.  
`Mailbox.@closed_fast` and `Pool.@closed_fast` are pure early rejections today  
and must stay so. Part 15.4 forbids keeping the fast read without the re-check,  
and this is the implementation half of that prohibition.

## 6.2 Creation is a transaction

Every creation path that can fail after its first allocation undoes exactly what  
succeeded before it. `defer catch`, in the shape `std::threads::channel` uses  
for the same problem.

Nothing partially constructed is ever returned, and nothing partially  
constructed is ever observable. A caller that receives a fault from `create` has  
no object and no obligation.

**This was not true until 3TK-8.** Section 9.

## 6.3 `close` is not `destroy`

```
close      changes container state, hands back or hands on what is held,
           wakes waiters. Callable more than once
release    ends the object's lifetime. Callable once, and only after close
```

They are never merged. A closed container is **still an item**: it has its inner  
and its identity, it can still sit on a list, and its outer may still need to  
transfer or release it. Part 11.12's tier 1 assert enforces the order and is one  
of only two `always_assert` sites in the port.

## 6.4 The hook boundary, and what survives it

Part 12.3: the pool unlocks, calls the hook, relocks. The implementation  
contract around that:

**Before the unlock** — every invariant another thread could observe already  
holds; the item is in neither the caller's Slot nor a pool list unless the  
operation intends it; the hook-local Slot holds the only temporary ownership.

**After the relock** — everything read before the unlock is **stale**. Counts,  
list lengths, emptiness, the closed flag: all of it is re-read. The hook's  
result is fresh input and is checked like any other input.

`Pool.put`'s two Slots — `mine` for the item, `extra` for the parts — fix the  
*caller's* semantics. They do not by themselves make arbitrary application code  
safe, and this section is the half that does.

## 6.5 No reference into bucket storage survives a hook call

The bucket array is fixed at creation, but its **contents** are mutable and a  
hook runs with the mutex released.

**The rule: after any call into application code, look the bucket up again by  
identity.** The lookup is linear over a small fixed set, and correctness beats  
preserving a pointer across code the toolkit does not control. `Pool.put` does  
exactly this — `take_back_handle` re-resolves — and it must not be "optimized"  
into hoisting the lookup out of the hook boundary.

**One deliberate exception**, and it is safe for a reason that is a property of  
creation rather than of the loop: `Pool.get_wait` holds a `PoolBucket*` across  
`wait_until`, which releases the mutex. The slice is allocated once in `create`  
and never grown, moved or reallocated, so the address is valid for the pool's  
life. Only the contents change, and they are re-read every turn of the loop.  
No application code runs in that window. The comment at the site says so.

## 6.6 The lock order is a statement about today

**No current toolkit path holds one container mutex while acquiring another.**  
Therefore the toolkit has no inter-container lock order.

That is narrower than 003's *"no path takes two locks, so there is no ordering  
to state"*, and deliberately. It holds because hooks run outside the lock, and  
because no operation coordinates a Mailbox and a Pool. An operation that ever  
does will need an order, and this sentence is where it goes.

## 6.7 The `AnyHandle` / `Slot` signature rule

```
returns AnyHandle    it transfers or exposes a handle
takes   Slot*        it may consume, fill, or preserve a transfer location
takes   AnyHandle    it observes or links a handle already owned per its contract
```

Sharper than "the Slot is distinct", because it is checkable. **Every public  
signature in `3tk/src/` was audited against it and none violates it.**

The rule also has a leg in the language, which is worth knowing before anyone  
proposes to make the two symmetrical. **M4: a method cannot attach to a pointer  
alias.** `alias AnyHandle = AnyNode*` can carry no methods at all; the distinct  
`typedef Slot` can, and does — `fill`, `take`, `peek`, `is_empty`, `is_full`.  
So a Slot reads like an object and a handle reads like a value partly because  
C3 will only let one of them be an object. D5 chose the distinct type for the  
compiler's sake; M4 says the choice also bought the only place behaviour could  
live.

# 7. What is dropped, and why

Beyond section 3's excluded surface.

| Dropped | Marking | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Interruption, Part 2.9 | SHOULD | **D9.** No interruptible condition wait in C3. The SHOULD's own text permits the drop |
| Hidden container internals, Part 11.11 | SHOULD | **D1.** The only C3 mechanism that delivers it costs Part 11.1 MUST |
| Bridging to the language's own list, Part 8.10 | MAY | Its condition is not met: the stdlib has no intrusive list of the same node type. Q7's reading of `collections/linkedlist.c3:9-14` |
| Test access to the raw list, Part 8.11 | MAY | There is no raw list under `NodeList`. C3 has `@test` functions in the same module, which reach the internals directly |
| The union-returning calls, Part 9.5 | MAY | Its stated purpose is a select mechanism. There is none, and Part 1.2 refuses to add one |
| The `interrupted` outcome, Part 19 | — | Follows from D9. Two rows lose one value |

Six drops. Two SHOULDs with written reasons, three MAYs whose conditions are  
not met, and one consequence.

# 8. Build and test

## 8.1 The project

One `project.json`. C9 is closed by writing a third shape rather than choosing  
between two that were never compiled.

```json
{
  "langrev": "1",
  "authors": [ "g41797" ],
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "sources": [ "src/**" ],
  "targets": {
    "mtk": { "type": "static-lib" },
    "mtk-test": { "type": "test", "sources": [ "src/**", "test/**" ] }
  }
}
```

`3tk-build-dist.md` B2 claims C3 library packaging is early alpha and `c3c dist`  
incomplete. **Unverified, and this stage did not verify it.** It affects  
distribution, not the port. The proposal ships source, as B6 suggests, and the  
question is a tooling stage's.

## 8.2 The four builds

**Every build runs every test applicable to that build, and the matrix covers  
all four.** D6's whole point is that the tiers behave differently across them,  
and a port that runs one build has exercised one tier. But "every test in every  
build" would be the wrong promise: a tier 3 check is *not compiled* in a fast  
build, so a test that asserts it fires has nothing to assert there. Section 8.3  
says which is which.

| Build | Flags | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| Safe, unoptimized | `--safe=yes -O0` | Tiers 1, 2 and 3 all live. Every check runs |
| Safe, optimized | `--safe=yes -O3` | The same, under an optimizer |
| Fast, unoptimized | `--safe=no -O0` | Tier 1 still aborts. Tiers 2 and 3 are gone |
| **Fast, optimized** | `--safe=no -O3` | **The one that segfaulted in Q11's probe.** Proves the port has no plain `assert` guarding a contract |

The fourth is not optional. It is the build in which C3's own `assert` becomes  
undefined behaviour, and the reason D6 exists.

**F1, and version 001 had this wrong.** 001 spelled the second build `-O3`.  
Measured on c3c 0.8.3, **`-O2` and above set `SAFE_MODE=false`**: `-O3` alone is  
the fast build under another name, and a suite run under it tests nothing the  
fast build has not already tested. The first run of `run-builds.sh` caught it —  
five negatives reported *did NOT abort in a checking build*.

**Never infer the build mode from the `-O` level.** Both sides are explicit,  
`--safe=yes` or `--safe=no`, in every build this port runs.

## 8.3 The tests

Grouped by what they establish, not by file.

**The invariants.** Part 18's thirty-four, each with at least one test naming  
its number. Twelve of them appear in no draft in this folder — the review's  
section 8 — so they are written from the specification and not from any prior  
C3 text.

**The six Slot rules.** One test each. Rule 4 — a failing acquisition leaves the  
Slot unchanged — needs a failure induced at every acquiring entry point, not  
just one.

**The double check.** Part 8.6's two cases, and the proof that neither alone  
suffices: a list of exactly one member, which only the walk catches, and an  
item on a *different* list, which only the link test catches. **Safe builds  
only, by construction** — the walk is tier 3 and is not compiled in a fast  
build, so there is nothing there to provoke. That is not a gap in the matrix; it  
is the tier doing what it was designed to do, and 7.2's opening sentence is  
worded to permit it.

**The deadline.** D7's anchor, tested the way Q7 tested the primitive: a wait  
woken spuriously several times must still time out at roughly the original  
deadline. A `wait_timeout`-based loop passes every naive timeout test and fails  
this one.

**The give-back rules.** Part 11.6 and 11.8, including the two named mistakes:  
discarding the list `close` returns, and a mid-batch `put_all` refusal leaving  
the rest with the caller at the front of their list.

**Close before release.** Tier 1, in all four builds, including the fast  
optimized one. The only test that asserts on an abort.

**The layering.** Section 5.12's claim, as a grep in the test script:  
`mailbox.c3` and `pool.c3` reference no `@private` name from the core four.  
Part 17.3 calls this the test of the design, so the port makes it one.

**A closed container is empty.** Invariant 34, both containers. Close one that  
is *holding* items, then assert it kept none and that every acquisition reports  
`CLOSED` with the Slot untouched. The pre-existing tests closed an empty  
container, which cannot tell invariant 34 from its absence.

**Concurrency.** Many producers and many consumers on one mailbox; hooks  
running in parallel on different threads; a `close` racing a `release`. Run  
under the four builds, and under a thread sanitizer where the toolchain offers  
one.

**Allocation failure**, added by 3TK-8 and living in `test/t_alloc.c3` — its own  
file, on the owner's instruction, because `common.c3` is the shared fixture that  
every other test compiles against and an allocator that fails on purpose does  
not belong in it. Two allocators: one that counts outstanding blocks, one that  
wraps it and refuses after a budget. The assertion is always the same — after a  
failed creation, nothing is outstanding.

**On what those tests can and cannot reach.** `Pool.create`'s bucket allocation  
is provokable and is provoked: budget 1 lets the `Pool` through and fails the  
array, which is the exact shape that leaked. `Mailbox.create` performs only one  
acquisition through the caller's allocator — its later failure points,  
`_mu.init()` and `_cv.init()`, allocate through the platform — so its cleanup is  
**correct by construction and untested**. The sabotage run says so plainly:  
removing the mailbox's `defer catch` pair leaves every test green, while  
removing the pool's fails one. That is written at the test site rather than left  
for a reader to discover.

## 8.4 What the numbers mean

The suite counts two different things and 002 reported them in one sentence.

| Category | Count | Runs in |
|---|---|---|
| Library builds | 1 per build | all four |
| The test suite, as one check | 1 per build | all four |
| Runtime negatives | 7 per build | all four, expecting an abort in the two safe builds and a clean exit in the two fast ones |
| Tier 1 negatives | 2 per build | all four, expecting an abort in **every** one |
| Compile-time refusals | 3 per build | all four, expecting the compile to fail with a message naming the offending type |
| Layering checks | 3, once | source, not a build |

- **"59 checks"** is the number of pass/fail lines the script prints: 14 per
  build × 4 builds, plus the 3 layering checks that are not per-build. **3TK-8  
  does not change this number** — it added tests, and the suite is one check  
  however many tests it contains.
- **"77 tests"** is the number of `@test` functions in the suite. They run in
  each of the four builds, and the suite as a whole is one of the 14 checks.  
  The 73 do not include the negatives; a negative is a separate program, and  
  its whole point is that it must not run to completion.
- **3TK-8 took it from 73 to 77**, all four in `test/t_alloc.c3`: three
  creation-failure tests and one whole-life test that proves the counting  
  allocator reaches zero on the ordinary path, so that a zero on a failure path  
  means something.
- The 7 runtime negatives are **not** among the 73, and each is judged
  differently in a safe build than in a fast one — one program, two expected  
  behaviours, both required.

**A negative program is compiled and run as two separately judged steps**, and  
that is not fussiness. `compile-run` reports a compile failure the same way it  
reports a `SIGABRT`: a non-zero exit. A negative that stopped compiling would  
therefore be read as a negative that aborted, and would pass forever having  
proved nothing. Section 9 records the one that did.

## 8.5 What the kitchen gate needs

`kitchen/tools/check_design.sh` exits 1 today, before this stage and after it.  
**63 problems after 3TK-8, up from 43** — and the whole rise is orphans, 29 to  
49, because `design/secondary/context.md` lists no `lang/` subfolder at all, so  
every file under it counts as one. 3TK-8 added two files and moved three into  
`backup/`; each move is a new path and therefore a new orphan row.

**The 14 dead links are unchanged**, all in `design/context.md`, all naming  
documents that predate this line of work. That number is the one that would  
signal a regression, and it did not move.

It is drift in `context.md`, not in this line of work, and it is not fixed here.  
Recorded with both numbers so the rise is not mistaken for damage.

# 8.6 The words this document uses

The port is terminology-heavy by design — Part 10.1 exists so a reader of a  
signature knows which side of a border they are on. The risk is that a prose  
distinction gets read as an API distinction. These are the pairs worth pinning:

| Use | Not | Because |
|---|---|---|
| two conceptual parts / three fields | "two parts" alone | Part 4.2 fixes the parts; the field count is the realization's |
| **crossing** | any conversion | Reserved for **outer ↔ inner**. It is what Part 7.5 confines to the helper |
| **Slot primitive** | "Slot crossing" | Reading a Slot as a handle is bookkeeping in one layer, not a crossing |
| **safe build** / **fast build** | "checking build" / "release build" | They name the flag: `--safe=yes`, `--safe=no`. Never inferred from `-O` |
| the pool **accepts** the item | "takes", "gets" | A defined transition: step 3 of `Pool.put`, after which the caller's Slot is empty |
| **internal by convention** | "private" | D1 made the fields public. Calling them private would claim a guarantee the port does not have |
| **compiler-hidden** | "hidden" | Only `@private` declarations are hidden, and only from outside the module |

# 9. The conflict register, closed

Every conflict of `3tk-drafts-review-001.md` section 9, with its state after  
this stage.

| # | Subject | State |

# 10. What was built from this

Both stages are done and this section is a record rather than a plan.

- **3TK-6** wrote steps 2 to 5 — `any.c3`, `helper.c3`, `owned.c3`, `list.c3`.
  The toolkit of Part 17.1. Nine findings, in `3tk-toolkit-notes-001.md`.
- **3TK-7** wrote steps 6 and 7 — `mailbox.c3`, `pool.c3`. The two optional
  tools of Part 17.2, depending on nothing in the first beyond its public  
  surface. Six findings, in `3tk-containers-notes-001.md`.
- **3TK-8** answered `3tk-porting-proposal-003-review.md`. It rewrote D1's
  argument without moving its ruling, added section 6, fixed one real defect in  
  both creation paths, and added `test/t_alloc.c3`. This file is its output.

**All four builds green: 59 checks, 0 failures.** **77** tests in each of four  
builds, 7 runtime negatives, 2 tier 1 negatives, 3 compile-time refusals, 3  
layering checks. Section 8.4 says what each number counts. `3tk/run-builds.sh`.

**Part 18 is complete: all thirty-four invariants are accounted for.**  
Twenty-nine are directly tested or deliberately provoked. Five are structural or  
documented, because their nature does not admit an independent runtime test, and  
each says which it is. *Complete* here means accounted for — it does not mean  
thirty-four executable tests.

Invariant 34 is the new one. It did not exist when 3TK-7 finished; this revision  
put it in the specification and then in the suite.

Sixteen decisions, sixteen exercised, sixteen survived. No decision has moved  
across three versions.

## What 3TK-8 found in the code

The review that produced this version was written about the *design*, and read  
`3tk/src/` only through the proposal. So its 28 items were re-audited against  
the source before any of them was accepted, and the audit changed most of the  
verdicts.

**One real defect, and the review could not have seen it.** Its §20 asks for  
`Pool.create` to be made transactional, reasoning about a design it thought  
might exist. Read against the code, the defect was real and **broader than its  
own framing** — neither creation path cleaned up after a partial failure:

- `Pool.create` allocated the `Pool`, then initialized a mutex, then a
  condition variable, then the bucket array. A failure at any of the last three  
  propagated straight out and **leaked everything already built**. The bucket  
  allocation is the largest and the likeliest to fail, and by then there was a  
  live `Pool`, a live mutex and a live condition variable to lose.
- `Mailbox.create` had the identical shape, one step shorter.

Both are now transactions — `defer catch`, undoing exactly what succeeded, in  
the shape `std::threads::channel` uses for the same problem. Section 6.2 states  
it as an invariant so it is not lost again.

**Two stages and two reviews walked past it.** It is worth asking why, because  
the answer is not carelessness. The leak is in an error path that an ordinary  
test never takes: on Linux with an ordinary allocator, `new_try` does not fail.  
Nothing in the suite could reach it, so nothing in the suite complained. The  
port had no way to make an allocator fail — which is why 3TK-8 built one, in  
`test/t_alloc.c3`, and why the file is the durable half of this fix.

**And the test was checked by sabotage, not by passing.** Removing the pool's  
`defer catch` lines turns the suite red on `pool_create_fails_at_the_buckets`.  
Removing the mailbox's leaves it green, because that path cannot be provoked  
through the caller's allocator at all. Both facts are written at the test site.  
A test whose failure is impossible is worse than no test, and saying which is  
which is the only honest way to ship one.

**Five items the code already satisfied**, three of them in better shape than  
the review assumed — the pre-lock atomic was already a hint, `close` was already  
not `destroy`, and `Pool.put` already re-resolved its bucket by identity after  
the hook rather than carrying a pointer across the unlock. Those became section  
6 instead of changes. That section is the most valuable thing in this revision:  
five invariants that were true only by habit are now true on purpose.

**One correction that is a document defect, not a code defect.** D1's argument  
was wrong for three versions. The ruling it defended was right the whole time,  
which is exactly why nobody checked the argument.

## What the 003 revision found in the code

Two things, and the second is the one worth remembering.

**`Pool.create` accepted a duplicate identity.** The review asked whether it  
should, the owner ruled that it should not, and it now refuses — tier 2, with a  
negative program that provokes it. Section 5.9 has the reasoning. The  
specification does not require this: Part 11.7 asks only that the set be fixed  
and not empty, so refusing duplicates is a port addition, made because the  
failure it prevents is silent.

**A tier 1 negative had never compiled, and the harness could not tell.**  
`release_open_pool.c3` spelled a type's identity `Msg.typeid`, which c3c 0.8.3  
rejects — the working spelling is the helper's `TYPE` const. The program had  
therefore never run. It was reported green in every build for the whole life of  
the suite, because the harness ran `compile-run` and read *any* non-zero exit as  
the abort it was looking for. A compile failure is a non-zero exit.

So the port's sharpest claim — Part 11.12, close before release, *the one  
precondition the specification refuses to soften*, the only site that aborts in  
all four builds — was resting on a program that never ran, on the pool side.

The fix is in two parts: the spelling, and the harness, which now compiles and  
runs as separately judged steps and fails loudly on a negative that will not  
build. The general lesson is D7's, arrived at from the other direction: **a test  
for an invariant is worth nothing until it has been seen to fail.** The  
duplicate-tag check was sabotaged and the suite went red in both checking builds  
before the sabotage was reverted; the same treatment is what would have caught  
this years earlier.

What is still not done is listed in `3tk-containers-notes-001.md`: no sanitizer  
run, the signal hand-off test is a race run twenty times, and linux-x64 is the  
only target built. Packaging was never in this line of work.

## Change log

| Version | Date | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 001 | 2026-08-23 | First version. Stage 3TK-5. Sixteen decisions, all PROPOSED. |
| 002 | 2026-08-23 | **Owner accepted all sixteen.** G1's submodules accepted. Amendments from the code folded in: F1's build flags, F3/F5's `@check`, F4's aliases, G2's `~`, G4's flat buckets, G5's two Slots. No decision moved. |
| 004 | 2026-08-23 | Answers `3tk-porting-proposal-003-review.md`, a review of design and implementation. **D1's argument rewritten and its ruling reaffirmed by the owner** — hiding is possible and is rejected on cost, not on Part 11.1. Nine measured answers added, Q13 to Q17 and M1 to M5, superseding `3tk-porting-proposal-addendum-001.md`. **Section 6 added**, six implementation invariants the code already honoured and no document stated. Four text corrections: the Part 4.2 row, D12, the 24 bytes, Part 15.2's lock statement. **One real defect fixed in code** — neither creation path was transactional — with `test/t_alloc.c3` and its two allocators added to provoke it. The `char[N]` storage rejected, the `NodeList` mutation core deferred with its reason. No decision moved. |
| 003 | 2026-08-23 | Answers `3tk-porting-proposal-review.md`. Three counting contradictions fixed. Section 0's central boundary, the Slot surface, `AnyHandle`'s nullability, the `@check` side-effect rule, `Pool.put`'s two Slot domains, the `NodeList` count invariant, the bucket construction rules, and section 7.4's counts glossary added. The layering and submodule claims narrowed to what they prove. Written against specification **002** and its invariant 34. One code change — `Pool.create` refuses duplicate identities — and one harness defect found and fixed. The review's `wake_all` suggestion rejected, its `receive_all` precedence question dissolved. No decision moved. |
