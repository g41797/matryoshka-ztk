# C3 capability study (002)

Stage 3TK-4, extended by 3TK-72 on 2026-09-09 with the failure half of Q6 —  
`defer catch`, and the fault it can bind. `001` is in this folder's `backup/`,  
which is transient.

Stage 3TK-4. The capability questionnaire of
[matryoshka-specification-001.md](../common/backup/matryoshka-specification-001.md) Part 21,
answered for C3, with a citation per answer.

Every answer marked **verified** was compiled and run. Every answer marked  
**read** comes from the stdlib sources only.

## The toolchain measured

- `c3c` 0.8.3, git `1d155ee`, LLVM 22.1.8, installed at
  `/home/g41797/dev/langs/c3`.
- Stdlib sources at `/home/g41797/dev/langs/c3/lib/std/`.
- Target `linux-x64`. Probes compiled with `c3c compile-run`, and where build
  mode mattered, with `--safe=no` and `-O0`/`-O3`.

Citations are `file:line` under `lib/std/`.

## What a probe is

A probe is a small program written for one question, compiled, and run. Its  
output is quoted in the answer. Probe sources are reproduced inline here rather  
than kept as files, so this document is self-contained.

Twelve probes were run for `001`, and **seven more for Q6 in `002`**, five of  
them negative. A negative probe is expected to fail to compile, and the  
compiler's message is the evidence.

## The short answer

| Q | Subject | C3 |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Compile-time generation over a type | **yes** — generic modules |
| Q2 | A per-type identity | **yes** — `typeid`, native |
| Q3 | Embedding and inner-to-outer arithmetic | **yes** — `inline` *and* `::members` offsets |
| Q4 | Opaque types or private fields | **half** — no private fields; a real opaque type instead |
| Q5 | Interfaces or vtables | **yes** — `interface` and `@dynamic` |
| Q6 | Scope-exit cleanup | **yes** — `defer`, and `defer catch` for the failure path |
| Q7 | Threads, mutex, timed condition wait | **yes** — including `wait_until` on an absolute deadline |
| Q8 | An allocator an object keeps for life | **yes** — `Allocator` is itself an interface |
| Q9 | A two-state container for the Slot | **yes** — nullable pointer, and it can be made distinct |
| Q10 | Atomics | **yes** — `Atomic{Type}` with orderings |
| Q11 | Build modes | **yes, with a trap** — see Q11 |
| Q12 | Compile-time reflection on fields | **yes** — `$Type::members` with `.name`, `.type`, `.offset` |

Eleven of twelve are a clean yes. C3 is a better host for Matryoshka than Zig  
0.16 is, on every axis the specification measures except one — Q4 — and the  
excluded surface of Part 16 shrinks by a whole file.

---

# Q1 — Compile-time generation over a type

**Yes. Generic modules.** Verified.

A module is parameterized on a type, and every declaration inside it is  
generated per instantiation.

```c3
module mtk::helper <Type>;
```

*Read*: `collections/list.c3:4`, `collections/linkedlist.c3:4`,  
`collections/maybe.c3:1` — the whole stdlib collection layer is built this way.

Instantiation is by brace, one alias per generated declaration:

```c3
alias msg_init     = mtk::helper::init{Msg};
alias msg_from_any = mtk::helper::from_any{Msg};
```

*Read*: `hash/sha256.c3:8-9`, `math/complex.c3:7-11`.

**Verified.** A complete per-type helper — Part 7.2's seven members — was  
generated for two outer types and exercised:

```
distinct tags        : true
Job inner offset     : 8
from_any right type  : true
from_any wrong type  : true
must_from_any        : true
move: got item       : true
move: slot cleared   : true
mismatch: nothing    : true
mismatch: untouched  : true
```

The last two lines are Part 7.2's moving crossing on a mismatch: nothing  
returned, Slot untouched.

**Consequence for the port.** Part 7.1's SHOULD is met in full. The helper is  
generated, not hand-written.

**Against the drafts.** `3tk-polyhelper.md` proposed  
`macro PolyHelper(Type) { ... fn ... }` with a body full of function  
declarations. That is not the mechanism. A C3 macro does not declare  
functions; a generic *module* does. The draft's overall shape survives; its  
spelling does not.

---

# Q2 — A per-type identity

**Yes. `typeid` is native, and it satisfies every clause of Part 5.1.**  
Verified.

The spelling is `Type::typeid`, with a double colon. `Type.typeid` does not  
compile — *"A type can't appear here."*

Probe output:

```
module-scope const typeid : true
Msg != Msg2 (same layout) : true
Msg == Msg                : true
stored in field, read back: true
typeid as uptr            : 47b328
```

Clause by clause against Part 5.1:

| Clause | Result |
|---|---|
| A value identifying the type of the outer | `typeid`, one word |
| Unique at runtime across all outer types | **`Msg` and `Msg2` have identical layouts and differ.** No merging |
| Two items of one type carry the same value | `Msg::typeid == Msg::typeid` |
| Two of different types never do | as above |
| O(1) to compare | a pointer-sized value, compared by `==` |

Part 5.4 — *stored, not computed* — holds: the value assigns to a struct field  
and reads back equal.

Part 5.3's second half does not apply. C3 has a native identifier, so the  
address-of-a-per-type-global trick, and ztk's mutable-byte defence against  
linker merging, are both unnecessary.

*Read*: `core/types.c3:83` `typeid.is_subtype_of`, `core/builtin.c3:145`  
`@typeid`, `core/builtin.c3:760` `typeid.hash`, `collections/object.c3:13` —  
the stdlib itself stores a `typeid` in a struct field for exactly this purpose.

**This closes conflict C1 of the review.** Four drafts assumed it; the fifth  
flagged it as the dangerous area. The four were right, and the assumption is  
now measured rather than assumed.

**One thing the ztk model gains.** Part 6.5 records that a `switch` over ztk's  
tags does not compile on any backend, because a tag is a linker-assigned  
address. In C3 it compiles:

```c3
switch (handle.type)
{
    case Msg.typeid: ...
    case Job.typeid: ...
    default:         ...
}
```

Verified — the probe printed `switch: Job`. So Part 6.5's dispatch table is  
optional for this port. The table remains the better shape where handlers are  
registered at runtime; the branch is available where they are not.

---

# Q3 — Embedding and inner-to-outer arithmetic

**Yes, both ways.** Verified.

**By value, with implicit conversion.** `inline` on the field gives an implicit  
outer-pointer to inner-pointer conversion:

```c3
struct Msg { inline AnyNode node; int id; }
Msg* pm = &m;
AnyNode* an = pm;      // implicit
```

Probe: `implicit Msg* -> AnyNode* : true`, and the result equals `&m.node`.

**At any offset, by arithmetic.** The offset of a field is available at compile  
time (Q12), so the way back works from a field that is not first:

```c3
struct Job { int pri; AnyNode node; String what; }   // inner at offset 8
Job* back = (Job*)((char*)node_ptr - OFF);
```

Probe: `Job inner offset : 8`, `inner -> outer at offset 8: true`.

**Consequence for the port.** Part 4.3's fallback — *"A port whose cast needs  
offset zero fixes the field at offset zero instead"* — is not needed. C3 has  
the full freedom the specification's SHOULD describes.

**This closes conflict C2 of the review.** `3tk-polyhelper.md` assumed offset  
zero and a plain cast; `3tk-design-notes.md` and `3tk-porting-notes.md` wanted  
`inline`. Both compile. They are not, however, the same design:

| | `inline AnyNode node` | `AnyNode node` at any offset |
|---|---|---|
| Outer to inner | implicit | `to_any()` through the helper |
| Field may sit anywhere | yes | yes |
| Reader sees the crossing | **no** | yes |

The second column is what Part 7.5 asks for: *every* crossing goes through the  
helper, so the arithmetic appears in one file. `inline` makes one direction of  
the crossing invisible at the call site. That is a real argument against  
`inline` that neither draft raised, and it is the owner's to weigh.

Note also Part 10.1: the four names exist so a reader of a signature knows  
which side of the border they are on. An implicit conversion erases that.

---

# Q4 — Opaque types or private fields

**No private fields. A real opaque type instead.** Verified, including two  
negative probes.

**Per-field visibility does not exist.**

```c3
struct Thing { int a; int b @private; }
```

> `Error: '@private' cannot be used here.`

Nothing in the stdlib uses per-field visibility. `@private` and `@local` apply  
to declarations — functions, globals, constants, whole types.  
*Read*: `collections/list.c3:426`, `core/dstring.c3:10`, `core/dstring.c3:749`.

**A private struct behind a public alias hides nothing.**

```c3
struct PoolImpl @private { ... int in_pool; ... }
alias Pool = PoolImpl;
```

Another module reads `p.in_pool` and it compiles. The alias re-exports the  
layout.

**A distinct opaque type does work.**

```c3
typedef Pool = void;                         // in the library module
fn int Pool.count(&self) => ((PoolImpl*)self).in_pool;
```

From another module: `p.count()` works, and `p.in_pool` gives

> `Error: There is no field or method 'Pool.in_pool'.`

**Consequence for the port.** Part 11.11 SHOULD says *"Where the language has  
opaque types or private fields, they are hidden"*, and calls this a place where  
a port can be better than ztk. C3 can be better, but only by the opaque route,  
and the opaque route costs something the drafts did not price:

- A `typedef Pool = void` is no longer a struct that embeds an inner. Part 11.1
  MUST — *the two containers are themselves items* — then has to be satisfied  
  through the implementation struct, and the helper for the container is bound  
  to `PoolImpl`, not to `Pool`.
- Every method body begins with a cast.

**Against the drafts.** `3tk-design-notes.md` D15 and `3tk-porting-notes.md`  
N19 both state that C3 private fields let the struct stay public while its  
state is hidden, and N19 builds a whole separation of concerns on it —  
*"private fields hide implementation state; typed handles restrict API usage.  
Do not mix these two reasons"*. The first half of that sentence describes a  
feature C3 does not have in 0.8.3. This is the study's sharpest correction, and  
it reopens a design question both drafts considered settled.

The honest options for the port are three, and none is free:

1. Public struct, public fields, a comment saying internal — exactly ztk, no
   better.
2. `typedef Pool = void` — real hiding, at the cost above.
3. Keep the fields public and rely on the helper border. Part 7.5 already makes
   the crossing single-sited; the fields being reachable is then a  
   documentation problem, not a structural one.

---

# Q5 — Interfaces or vtables

**Yes.** Verified.

```c3
interface PoolHooks
{
    fn void on_get(typeid want, AnyHandle* slot);
    fn void on_put(AnyHandle* slot);
    fn void on_close(AnyHandle list);
}

struct MyHooks (PoolHooks) { int made; }
fn void MyHooks.on_get(&self, typeid want, AnyHandle* slot) @dynamic { ... }
```

Probe: `interface dispatch : true`.

Three further facts, each verified:

- An interface value is **nullable**. An unset one compares equal to `null`.
- An interface value **carries the concrete typeid**: `h.type == Hk::typeid`.
- The stdlib's own `Allocator` is an interface. *Read*: `core/alloc.c3:17`.

**Consequence for the port.** Part 12.1 MUST — *"The port spells them in the  
language's own interface mechanism"* — is met directly. The `ctx` field of the  
ztk hook struct disappears, because the implementing object is the context.  
Part 21 Q5's fallback is not needed.

**This closes conflict C5 of the review**, on the mechanism. It does not close  
the signatures. The probe deliberately used the signatures the *specification*  
requires, not the ones `3tk-additions.md` proposed:

- `on_get` takes the wanted identity and a **Slot to fill** — Part 12.2, "The
  Slot is empty on entry. Create one, or leave the Slot empty."
- `on_put` takes a **Slot**, so all four outcomes of Part 12.2 are expressible,
  and the extra list of Part 12.5 can be added as a second parameter.
- `on_close` takes **the list of what remained** — Part 12.2, and Part 11.8,
  since nothing comes back to the caller.

All three compile as written. The draft's three signatures were not a C3  
limitation; they were a misreading.

`tags` — Part 11.7's fixed, non-empty set of identities — is a creation  
parameter of the pool, not a member of the hook object. Nothing in C3 pushes it  
either way, and `3tk-additions.md` A6's hedge was right to hedge.

---

# Q6 — Scope-exit cleanup

**Yes. `defer`, in three forms.** Verified.

The stdlib relies on it heavily, including for allocator swapping.  
*Read*: `core/mem.c3:510`.

There is also a scoped-lock macro that takes a body:

```c3
macro void Mutex.@in_lock(&mutex; @body)
```

*Read*: `threads/thread.c3:71`.

## The three forms, and the one Zig does not have

| form | runs on |
|---|---|
| `defer` | every exit from the scope |
| `defer catch` | the **fault** exit only |
| `defer try` | the **success** exit only |

**`defer catch` is Zig's `errdefer`.** `defer try` has no Zig spelling: it is  
the cleanup that runs only when the function succeeded, which in Zig is written  
by hand at the end of the happy path.

**All three verified together, and the two conditional forms are exclusive** —  
exactly one fires per exit. A function carrying both, called twice:

```
failing:
  defer catch ran
  caller saw p10::BOOM
succeeding:
  defer try ran
```

## `defer catch` can bind the fault

**Documented and verified.** `MANUAL.md` §6_12_2 gives both forms —  
`defer catch { ... }` and `defer (catch err) { ... }` — and says of the second:  
*"In the latter form the fault is captured, which can be convenient for logging  
the fault."* The manual's own worked example frees a buffer and logs inside one.  
**3TK-72 probed it on 2026-09-09 and it behaves as documented**; the probe is  
kept here because the study is meant to be self-contained, not because the  
manual was in doubt.

The fault is available the way `errdefer |err|` makes it available, and the  
parentheses go around the whole `catch f` — **not** around the binding:

```c3
defer (catch f) { io::printfn("unwind, fault = %s", f); }
```

Probe, run on c3c 0.8.3:

```c3
module p9;
import std::io;
faultdef BOOM, OTHER;

fn void? work(bool fail, bool second)
{
    defer (catch f) { io::printfn("  unwind, fault = %s", f); }
    if (fail) return second ? OTHER~ : BOOM~;
    io::printn("  success path");
}
```

Called three times — failing with `BOOM`, failing with `OTHER`, and  
succeeding — it prints:

```
fail with BOOM:
  unwind, fault = p9::BOOM
  caller saw p9::BOOM
fail with OTHER:
  unwind, fault = p9::OTHER
  caller saw p9::OTHER
no failure:
  success path
```

So the binding carries **the actual fault**, not a generic marker, and the defer  
does not run on the success path.

**Five spellings were probed and all five are refused.** None of them is in the  
manual; they are the shapes a reader coming from Zig, or guessing, will try  
first. The error messages are misleading, which is the reason to write them  
down:

| tried | c3c 0.8.3 says |
|---|---|
| `defer catch f ...` | *Expected a type here.* |
| `defer catch (f) ...` | *Expected ';'* |
| `defer catch (fault f) ...` | *Expected ')'.* |
| `defer catch anyfault f ...` | *Expected a type here.* |
| `defer catch \|f\| ...` (Zig's own) | *An expression was expected.* |

*Expected a type here* reads as though a type annotation would fix it. It would  
not. **The paren goes around `catch f`.**

**A vocabulary note, because the manual and the port differ.** `MANUAL.md` calls  
the captured value an **Excuse** — what an Optional carries when it has no  
result. 3tk and the shared specification call it a **fault** throughout, and  
this study keeps the port's word. They are the same value.

## Where the port stands on it

**Nothing in `mtk` uses the bound form, and nothing in the C3 standard library  
does either** — every site is the plain `defer catch`, including the four in  
`std::threads`' channels. `Mailbox.create` and `Pool.create` have no use for it:  
they unwind the same way whichever `init` failed.

**The two rules that place a `defer catch` correctly**, which is what  
`Mailbox.create` demonstrates and what `MANUAL.md` §6_12_2 cautions about in its  
own words — *"make sure the `defer` or `defer catch` are declared as close to  
the resource declaration as possible"*, because a `!` rethrow before the  
declaration leaks:

- **A cleanup is registered on the far side of the call that creates the thing**
  — `defer catch mb._mu.destroy();` goes *after* `mb._mu.init()!`, never before,  
  because a defer is a runtime registration and registering it earlier arms a  
  `destroy` on a mutex that `init` may never have built.
- **Defers run LIFO**, so resources are released in the reverse of the order
  they were acquired — the mutex before the block it lives in.

**A fault is returned with `~`, not `?`** — `return BOOM~;`. The `?` spelling is  
another language's habit, and 3TK-50 step 8 wrote it once before the build  
caught it.

**Consequence for the port.** Part 9.7 SHOULD — the release of a Slot is  
arranged *before* the acquisition that fills it — is one line. The  
write-it-at-every-exit fallback is not needed.

---

# Q7 — Threads, a mutex, a condition variable with a timed wait

**Yes, all four, and the timed wait is the good kind.** Verified.

*Read*: `threads/thread.c3:11-17` — `Mutex`, `TimedMutex`,  
`ConditionVariable`, `Thread`, `OnceFlag`, all as typedefs over native types.

The condition variable has **three** waits. *Read*: `threads/thread.c3:78-104`.

| Call | Shape |
|---|---|
| `wait(mutex)` | untimed |
| `wait_timeout(mutex, ms or Duration)` | relative |
| `wait_until(mutex, Time)` | **absolute deadline** |

This matters more than it looks. Part 2.5 MUST — *the deadline is anchored  
once, before the loop* — and invariant 4 of Part 18. The relative form  
recomputes the deadline on every call:

```c3
fn void? NativeConditionVariable.wait_timeout(&cond, NativeMutex* mtx, long ms)
{
    Time time = time::now() + time::ms(ms);
    return cond.wait_until(mtx, time) @inline;
}
```

*Read*: `threads/os/thread_posix.c3:158-162`.

**So a wait loop written on `wait_timeout` violates Part 2.5**, and does so  
silently — every spurious wakeup restarts the full timeout, without bound.  
This is exactly the defect the review found in `3tk-poc.md` (row P7), and C3  
makes it easy to write. The port anchors once and loops on `wait_until`.

Verified, both directions:

```
received under deadline : true
elapsed under 500ms     : true
past deadline times out : true
```

A deadline already in the past returns immediately with `thread::WAIT_TIMEOUT`.

The timeout is reported as a fault, not a return value:  
`if (catch f = cv.wait_until(&mu, deadline)) { ... f == thread::WAIT_TIMEOUT ... }`.  
*Read*: `threads/thread.c3:22-31` for the `faultdef` set, and  
`threads/os/thread_posix.c3:179-194` for `ETIMEDOUT`.

`broadcast` exists — *read*: `threads/thread.c3:81` — which Part 11.5's  
wake-every-waiter needs.

**Consequence for the port. Part 16 row 7 is deleted.** ztk hand-wrote a timed  
condition wait, 71 lines, because Zig 0.16 has none. C3 has one, in the  
stdlib, on an absolute deadline. Rows 1 to 11 of Part 16 go with the rest of  
`std.Io`. Every draft agreed there is no `std.Io` equivalent, and every draft  
was right.

**Interruption — Part 2.9, a SHOULD — has no native support.** `INTERRUPTED`  
exists as a fault, but only for `sleep` and for `TimedMutex.lock_timeout` on  
`EINTR`. *Read*: `threads/os/thread_posix.c3:94`, `:334`. There is no  
interruptible condition wait. A port that wants Part 2.9 builds it from a flag  
and a broadcast. Part 20 decision 8 stands open, and C3 does not settle it.

---

# Q8 — An allocator an object keeps for life

**Yes.** Verified.

`Allocator` is an interface, so it is one pointer-plus-type value that stores  
in a field. *Read*: `core/alloc.c3:17`.

```c3
struct PoolImpl { inline AnyNode node; int in_pool; Allocator alloc; }
fn void Pool.release(&self) { alloc::free(self.alloc, self); }   // no parameter
```

Verified: created through `alloc::new(a, PoolImpl)`, released through the kept  
allocator with no second argument.

*Read*: `core/alloc.c3:179` `new`, `core/alloc.c3:113` `free`,  
`core/allocators.c3:18` — `mem` is a builtin alias for the thread allocator, so  
a default exists without a global dependency being forced on the library.

**Consequence for the port.** Part 13.1 SHOULD is met in full, including its  
sharp clause: *no release call takes an allocator as a parameter*. Part 13.5  
does not apply — allocation is parameterized.

**Conflict C7 of the review stays open, and narrows.** The language imposes  
nothing. Part 13.4 leaves the application-item half to the port, Part 20  
decision 2 lists it, and the first open question in `3tk-status.md` is the same  
question. `3tk-polyhelper.md` H9 wrote `destroy(Allocator, slot)`; that is now  
a choice, not a necessity, and Part 13.1 says which way to choose for the two  
containers at least.

---

# Q9 — A two-state container for the Slot

**Yes, and it can be made distinct.** Verified, with two negative probes.

Pointers are nullable by default, so `AnyNode*` is already a two-state  
container. That is the transparent option, and it is what the drafts propose.

The distinct option also works:

```c3
typedef Slot = AnyHandle;
```

and it is enforced in both directions:

> `Error: Implicitly casting 'AnyHandle' (AnyNode*) to 'Slot' is not permitted`

> `Error: Implicitly casting 'Slot*' to 'AnyHandle*' (AnyNode**) is not permitted`

A zero-initialized `Slot` is null, so Part 9.2 rule 2 — *a Slot starts empty* —  
is the default state.

There is also `std::collections::maybe` — a `{value, has_value}` struct,  
generic. *Read*: `collections/maybe.c3:1-8`. It is not needed for a pointer and  
costs a word.

**Consequence for the port.** Part 9.9 MAY, and Part 20 decision 1, are live  
and both options are real. The distinct type catches misuse at compile time and  
costs the language's own null test, exactly as Part 9.9 predicts.

**On conflict C4 of the review — the naming.** The probes make the shape plain.  
The Slot is the nullable handle. `AnyHandle*` is a *pointer to* a Slot, which is  
what Part 9.3 says an acquiring operation takes. Four drafts call the double  
pointer "the Slot". Nothing in C3 forces or excuses that; it is a word to fix,  
and Part 9.2's six rules are unstateable until it is.

**On conflict C10 — typed handles.** The second negative probe is the cost  
`3tk-additions.md` A15 predicted and `3tk-porting-notes.md` N4 did not price:  
a distinct handle type means every Slot-shaped call site writes  
`(AnyHandle*)&h`. Part 7.5 MUST says application code never performs the  
crossing by hand and the arithmetic appears in one file. A cast at every call  
site is the opposite of that. The language confirms the cost; the ruling is  
still the owner's.

---

# Q10 — Atomics

**Yes.** Verified.

```c3
struct Atomic <Type> { Type data; }
```

*Read*: `atomic.c3:10`. Load and store take an `AtomicOrdering` — `RELAXED`,  
`ACQUIRE`, `RELEASE`, `ACQUIRE_RELEASE`, `SEQ_CONSISTENT` — with contracts  
rejecting the invalid combinations. *Read*: `atomic.c3:19-31`.  
`compare_exchange` takes separate success and failure orderings.  
*Read*: `atomic.c3:49`.

There is also a standalone fence: `thread::fence($ordering)`.  
*Read*: `threads/thread.c3:66`.

Probe: `atomic acquire load : true`, after a `RELEASE` store.

**Consequence for the port.** Part 15.4's pre-lock fast path is available, and  
Part 15.3's closed flag has its natural spelling. Part 14.2 — *the transfer  
orders memory* — is expressible. Part 20 decision 9 stays a design choice, not  
a capability question.

---

# Q11 — Build modes

**Yes, and there is a trap the specification's model does not cover.**  
Verified across four builds.

Two assert forms exist.

| Form | Safe build (default) | `--safe=no -O0` | `--safe=no -O3` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `assert(cond, msg)` | aborts, names the message | **no-op, execution continues** | **undefined behaviour — segfault** |
| `always_assert(cond, msg)` | aborts | aborts | aborts |

*Read*: `core/builtin.c3:158` — `always_assert` is a plain runtime check with  
`abort`, unconditional.

Build mode is readable at compile time:

```c3
const bool COMPILER_SAFE_MODE = $feat(SAFE_MODE);
const bool TESTING = $feat(TESTING);
const CompilerOptLevel COMPILER_OPT_LEVEL = ...;
```

*Read*: `core/env.c3:129-140`. Verified: a default build reports  
`SAFE_MODE=true OPT=O0`; `--safe=no -O3` reports `SAFE_MODE=false OPT=O2`.

**The trap.** In ztk's model an assert that is compiled out is *gone*. In C3 at  
`--safe=no` with optimization, a plain `assert` becomes an assumption the  
optimizer is entitled to act on. A violated assert is then not a missed check —  
it is undefined behaviour. The probe segfaults, having printed nothing at all,  
in a program whose only fault is one false `assert`.

**Consequence for the port.** Three places in the specification depend on this,  
and each gets a different answer:

- **Part 11.12 MUST** — close before release *"stops the program. In every
  build mode. Not an assert that compiles out."* → `always_assert`. This is the  
  one call the specification refuses to soften, and C3 has exactly the right  
  primitive for it.
- **Part 8.6 SHOULD** — the double check on insert, *"under a build mode that
  checks"* → guard the O(n) walk with `$if env::COMPILER_SAFE_MODE`, so the  
  loop is not merely unchecked in a fast build but absent from it.
- **Part 15.5 SHOULD** — asserts versus reported outcomes → plain `assert`, and
  the port writes down that a violated one is UB in an optimized unsafe build,  
  not a silent pass.

Part 20 decision 10 — *where does the O(n) insert check live on a port with no  
build modes* — does not arise. C3 has build modes.

Tests are first class: `fn ... @test`, run by `c3c compile-test`. Verified:  
`1 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped`.

# Q12 — Compile-time reflection on a struct's fields

**Yes.** Verified.

```c3
$foreach $m : Off::members:
    // $m.name   $m.type   $m.offset
$endforeach
```

Probe output for `struct Off { int pad; AnyNode node; double d; }`:

```
name=pad  offset=0
name=node offset=8
name=d    offset=32
```

*Read*: `io/formatter.c3:38-48` and `encoding/json_marshal.c3:44` use the same  
mechanism.

The property spellings that exist in 0.8.3, since three drafts guessed  
otherwise: `Type::members`, `Type::name`, `Type::typeid`, `Type::size`,  
`Type::alignment`, `Type::kind`, `Type::inner`, `Type::len`. Not `sizeof`, not  
`nameof`, not `membersof`, and not `.offsetof` on a member — it is `.offset`.

**Consequence for the port.** Part 7.4 SHOULD is met at build time, in full,  
including its last clause — *the message names the offending type*:

```c3
$assert $off >= 0 : "type " +++ Type::name +++ " has no AnyNode field";
```

Verified against a type with no inner:

> `Error: type NotAnItem has no AnyNode field`

That is Part 7.4's four bullets, all four, before the program links.

**One mechanical note worth carrying.** A `return` inside `$foreach` does not  
end compile-time iteration. The offset lookup accumulates into a `var $off` and  
asserts afterwards; written the obvious way it always reaches the `$error`.

# Verified spellings

The drafts guessed at C3 syntax in a dozen places. What compiles, in 0.8.3:

| Subject | Draft guess | Actual |
|---|---|---|
| Type identity | `Type::typeid` (`3tk-polyhelper.md`) | **`Type::typeid`** — correct |
| Generated helper | `macro PolyHelper(Type) { fn ... }` | `module m::helper <Type>;` plus `alias f = m::helper::f{Type}` |
| Contracts | `fn ... @require(cond)` | `<* @require cond : "message" *>` above the function |
| Field offset | not attempted | `$Type::members` → `$m.offset` |
| Size | `Type.sizeof` | `Type::size` |
| Type name | `Type.nameof` | `Type::name` |
| Field list | `Type.membersof` | `Type::members` |
| Create/destroy opt-out | `$if !Type.has_tag("no_create_destroy")` | no such property. Two generic modules, or a second parameter |
| Slot alias | `typedef Slot = ItemHandle?` | `alias AnyHandle = AnyNode*` (transparent) or `typedef Slot = AnyHandle` (distinct) |
| Allocator calls | `allocator.alloc(Type)` | `alloc::new(a, Type)`, `alloc::free(a, p)` |
| Module named `any` | proposed by three drafts | **rejected** — reserved keyword |
| Fault-bound rollback | `defer catch f` / `defer catch \|f\|` | **`defer (catch f)`** — paren around `catch f` |
| Returning a fault | `return BOOM?;` | **`return BOOM~;`** |
| Type named `Any` | disputed | **accepted** — `struct Any` and `alias Any` both compile |

Two naming hazards found while probing, neither in any draft:

- **A struct name that is all uppercase is rejected.** `struct H` does not
  compile. Short helper names need a lowercase letter.
- **`std::collections::anylist` already exists**, and it is a heterogeneous
  list that **shallow-copies every element and owns the copies**  
  (*read*: `collections/anylist.c3:4-19`). It is the semantic opposite of the  
  Matryoshka list, under the exact name the drafts chose for it. Naming the  
  port's list `AnyList` invites a reader to assume the wrong thing.

# What this study rules on

The eleven conflicts of
[3tk-drafts-review-001.md](3tk-drafts-review-001.md) section 9, so far as a
capability study can rule on them.

| # | Subject | Ruling |
|---|---|---|
| **C1** | Does `typeid` satisfy Part 5.1? | **Closed. Yes**, every clause, measured. Two identically-shaped types differ |
| **C2** | `inline`, or first field? | **Both compile.** Offset arithmetic works at any offset, so `inline` is not required for layout freedom. Left open, with a new argument: `inline` hides one direction of the crossing, against Part 7.5 |
| **C3** | Is `Any` usable? | **Closed.** As a **type name**, yes. As a **module name**, no — reserved. `3tk-porting-notes.md` was right, `3tk-additions.md` was right about the keyword and wrong about the consequence |
| **C4** | What is the Slot? | **Not a C3 question.** Part 9.1 already answers it. Both representations compile; the word is attached to the wrong half in four drafts |
| **C5** | Hooks: interface or struct? | **Closed on the mechanism. Interface**, per Part 12.1, verified. The three signatures in `3tk-additions.md` remain wrong against Part 12.2, and the corrected ones compile |
| **C6** | The `AnyList` surface | **Not a C3 question.** Part 8.2 has the full list. Note the name collision above |
| **C7** | Allocator at release? | **Open, and narrowed.** C3 imposes nothing. Part 13.1 settles the two containers; Part 13.4 and Part 20 decision 2 leave application items to the owner |
| **C8** | Where the list goes in the order | **Not a C3 question.** Part 22 is a suggestion. Note that the helper now needs no prototyping stage of its own — it was prototyped here |
| **C9** | Two `project.json` shapes | **Untouched.** Out of this stage's scope |
| **C10** | Typed handles | **Cost confirmed.** A distinct handle type forces an explicit cast at every Slot-shaped call site. The ruling is the owner's; the language has stated the price |
| **C11** | `polynode` or `AnyNode` naming | **Untouched**, except that `anylist` is taken by the stdlib |

And one thing the study found that the review did not ask about:

**Q4 reopens a settled question.** `3tk-design-notes.md` D15 and  
`3tk-porting-notes.md` N19 both build on C3 private struct fields. There are  
none. Part 11.11's "a port can be better than ztk here" is still reachable, by  
the opaque-type route, at a cost neither draft priced.

---

# What Matryoshka gains, and what it still pays

**Gains, measured.**

- The whole of Part 16 rows 1 to 11 disappears with `std.Io`, and **row 7 — the
  hand-written timed condition wait, 71 lines — disappears because C3 has one**.
- Part 5's identity is native. No per-type global, no defence against linker
  merging, no mutable byte.
- Part 7.4's validation runs at build time and names the offending type.
- Part 6.5's dispatch may be a `switch`. ztk cannot.
- Part 12.1's hooks are an interface, and `ctx` disappears with it.
- Part 9.7's cleanup-before-acquisition is one `defer`.
- Part 13.1's release-without-an-allocator-parameter is natural.

**Still paid.**

- **Q4.** No private fields. Hiding costs an opaque type, and an opaque
  container is no longer literally the struct that embeds the inner.
- **Part 2.9.** No interruptible condition wait. A port that models
  interruption builds it.
- **Q11.** A plain `assert` under `--safe=no -O3` is an assumption, not a
  removed check. Part 11.12's unconditional stop must be `always_assert`, and  
  Part 8.6's O(n) walk must be `$if`-guarded rather than assert-guarded.
- **Part 8.1.** No intrusive doubly-linked list in the stdlib. The stdlib's
  `linkedlist` allocates a node per element (*read*:  
  `collections/linkedlist.c3:9-14`) and its `anylist` copies. The port writes  
  its own — which Part 8.5 requires in any case.

---

# For 3TK-5

Carried forward, in the order the porting proposal will need them.

1. **The Q4 decision.** Three options are listed under Q4. It is now a real
   decision, not a settled assumption, and it touches Part 11.1 and Part 11.11.
2. **The C2 decision**, with the new argument: `inline` versus an explicit
   crossing through the helper, weighed against Part 7.5 and Part 10.1.
3. **The C7 decision**, jointly with the first open question of
   `3tk-status.md`.
4. **The C10 decision**, now that the cast cost is confirmed.
5. **The assert policy.** Which of the three forms — `always_assert`, `assert`,
   `$if`-guarded block — applies at each site. Part 8.6, Part 11.12, Part 15.5.
6. **The `wait_until` rule**, written down once: anchor the deadline before the
   loop, never loop on `wait_timeout`.
7. **The names.** `AnyList` collides with `std::collections::anylist`. `Any` is
   available as a type, unavailable as a module. No all-uppercase type names.
8. **Interruption.** Part 20 decision 8, with no native support to lean on.

Nothing in Part 21 blocks the port. Every "no" in this study is a cost the port  
pays knowingly, and there are four of them.
