## 2026-09-10 — 3TK-76: the sweep, and one name off Rule 8's list

**Ran on Opus 5 and closed. `036` is spent.** The last stage of the plan, and the  
one Rule 11 said had to wait for `3TK-75`: **94 call sites in `test/` and  
`negative/` moved off `inner::internal::*` and onto `OuterHelper`.**

**Every figure is identical to `3TK-75`'s, which is the whole proof.**  
`run-builds.sh` **123 checks**, 0 failures, four builds green, **146 tests** in  
each. `check-doc-loop.sh` **11 labelled blocks, 0 differing, 463 descriptor  
sentences, 463 found, 0 missing, 0 banned words**. `move-module-docs.sh  
roundtrip` byte-identical over eleven blocks. `run-sanitizers.sh` **3 of 3  
clean, 146 tests in each**. **A sweep that changed a test count changed a test**,  
and none of these moved.

**The population was 117, not the plan's 113.** Measured on the built tree  
before the first edit: `test/` **104** and `negative/` **13**, against the plan's  
98 and 15. Rule 13 — the measurement wins and the stage says so. The plan's  
`negative/` figure counted the two programs `3TK-75` was still to write, and  
they turned out to need no bypass at all. `examples/` was 2 and untouched, both  
sanctioned by name at `run-builds.sh:306`.

**The exemplar was `t_slot.c3`, eleven sites, and it decided one thing.** The  
conversions themselves were one-for-one off the plan's table. What the exemplar  
settled is that **the doc block moves with the code**: `a_look_is_not_a_take`  
described its subject in terms of `from_slot` and `move_from_slot`, and a test  
whose prose names the layer beneath the line it runs is worse than one that  
names neither. `look` and `take` in the prose, and the sweep carried that rule.

**The partition, and where it was not the plan's.** `t_queue.c3` (44),  
`t_mailbox.c3` (15), `t_pool.c3` (4), `t_concurrency.c3` (2) and `t_slot.c3`  
(11) are black box entire. **`t_identity.c3` split 8 and 18**: the four pushes  
that feed the heterogeneous walk, the two `Inner*` bindings in  
`the_methods_cross_the_same_border`, the refill in  
`the_slot_methods_cross_the_same_border` and the crossing out in  
`identity_is_stored` are plumbing and swept; the rest is the border on its own  
subject and stayed, **each remaining shape now carrying its sentence** — the  
offset arithmetic, the checking crossing's refusal, the null tolerance, the  
claim inside the walk, the method-against-macro line, and `to_inner`'s own null  
contract.

**`overwrite_slot` came off Rule 8's list, and this is the stage's one ruling.**  
`006` named it among the negatives where *the bypass IS the violation*. Read  
line by line, it is not one: its violation is the second `fill` on a full Slot,  
and the crossing that reaches the inner is plumbing beside it. **`MSG.inner`  
aborts at neither**, so the program proves exactly what it proved before — and  
`run-builds.sh` confirms it still aborts in the safe builds and still runs to  
the end in the fast ones. **The alternative was a sentence at the site that  
would not have been true**, Rule 8 forbidding a reference to a plan in its  
place. The other seven names were each checked the same way and each stayed:  
`unstamped_insert` and `unstamped_crossing` would abort one line early through  
the wrapper, at the crossing rather than at the boundary each exists to prove;  
`wrong_type_must` is the abort under test; the two `nocompile_` programs need  
the refusal to come from the crossing itself.

**So `3tk-rules-007.md` replaces `006`**, Rule 14, in the stage and without  
asking. **One list corrected and nothing else** — Rules 1–7 and 9–14 are `006`'s  
word for word, and the numbering did not shift. `006` is in  
`matryoshka-3tk/design/backup/`, and the five live links in  
`3tk-example-rules-006.md` and `3tk-decisions-007.md` were re-anchored in the  
same stage.

**Step 4 was spent before it began**, as the status said: `3TK-75` wrote `C-7`  
into both files. The stage checked the wording instead of writing it, and  
re-measured the promise it makes — **the ten callers of `Slot.to`, `Slot.must`,  
`Slot.move`, `Inner.to` and `Inner.as` are still ten and still all in  
`t_identity.c3`**, none of them touched by the sweep.

**Nothing was ported and nothing was owed.** No script and no `.yml` changed, so  
Rule 12's carry is empty this stage; the four ported scripts still differ from  
`matryoshka-3tk/scripts/` in the `ROOT` line alone, checked. **`src/` was not  
opened**, which is why the doc loop could not move.

**What `3TK-76` adds to the owner's copy queue**: `test/t_slot.c3`,  
`test/t_queue.c3`, `test/t_mailbox.c3`, `test/t_pool.c3`,  
`test/t_concurrency.c3`, `test/t_identity.c3`, and six under `negative/` —  
`insert_linked_outer.c3`, `insert_twice_same_queue.c3`, `self_move.c3`,  
`release_during_on_put.c3`, `release_with_straggler_put.c3`,  
`overwrite_slot.c3`, plus the five whose doc blocks gained a sentence:  
`unstamped_insert.c3`, `unstamped_crossing.c3`, `wrong_type_must.c3`,  
`nocompile_no_inner.c3`, `nocompile_two_inners.c3`.

## 2026-09-10 — 3TK-75: the helper stopped writing

**Ran on Opus 5 and closed. Six steps, all six.** `036`'s first stage, and the  
one that changes what the helper *means*: `OuterHelper.inner` no longer stamps.  
Rulings `C-1` … `C-8` of
[3tk-staging-plan-036.md](3tk-staging-plan-036.md), applied as written.

**The figures, and they moved because the stage added programs.**  
`run-builds.sh` **115 → 123 checks**, 0 failures, four builds green, **145 → 146  
tests** in each. The eight are two new runtime negatives run once per build; the  
one test is the null pass-through. `check-doc-loop.sh` **458 → 463** descriptor  
sentences, 463 found, 0 missing, 11 labelled blocks, 0 differing, 0 banned words.  
`move-module-docs.sh roundtrip` byte-identical over eleven blocks.  
**`run-sanitizers.sh` 3 of 3 clean, 146 tests in each**, and that is the run that  
mattered: removing a write is a concurrency change, and thread and address both  
went clean at `safe -O0`, `fast -O3` and `safe -O0`.

**What `inner()` is now.** `mtk::@check` plus `is_mine`, tolerating null, then  
`to_inner`. **It is strictly more than the stamp it replaced.** A stamp covered a  
forgotten identity by writing one and then agreed with itself at every later  
crossing; the check catches the forgotten stamp **and** the wrong type, writes  
nothing, and is not compiled at all under `--safe=no`. The doc block was  
rewritten rather than patched, and it says who owns the stamp: `create` stamps  
what it makes, `stamp` stamps what you made, this door only reads.

**One new test in `test/`, and TWO new negatives rather than one — Rule 13.**  
`C-8` asked for "one new test" covering three claims: the abort on an unstamped  
outer, the abort on a wrong-typed one, and null passing through. **A negative  
program provokes exactly one violation and then aborts**, so the two aborts  
cannot share a program and neither can live in `test/` at all. The stage revised  
the definition in passing and kept going, which is what Rule 13 is for. What was  
written: `the_reading_door_passes_null_through` in `t_helper.c3`, and  
`negative/unstamped_inner` and `negative/wrong_type_inner`, both registered in  
`RUNTIME_NEGATIVES`. **`wrong_type_inner` is the half no stamp could ever have  
caught**, and it is the clearest single argument for `C-1`: the old `inner()`  
would have re-stamped a `Msg` as a `Job` and every crossing afterwards would have  
agreed.

**The identity is now asserted at three boundaries, not two**, and the reference  
says so where it used to explain why there were two. The third is the crossing  
**out**: an outer that never reaches a queue and is never crossed back still  
leaves through `inner()`.

**`C-8`'s two corrections.** `inner_stamps_on_the_way_out` became  
`stamp_gives_a_hand_made_outer_its_identity` — its subject was always that a  
hand-made outer gets an identity, and that is `stamp`'s job — and it now also  
checks the outer crosses back. `the_stamp_is_idempotent_and_safe_on_a_linked_outer`  
**stays, with its doc block narrowed to say single-threaded** and to say why:  
leaving the wording is how a later stage talks itself back into a write.

**The two `src/` exceptions went, and their comments with them.**  
`mailbox.c3:51` is `MBOX.inner((_Mbox*)p)` and `pool.c3:163` is  
`POOL.inner((_Pool*)p)`. What replaced a raw crossing at those two sites is a  
read-only check that is gone in a release build — the containers pay nothing for  
it where it would cost.

**`linked` took its `Inner*` overload, and `C-4` was right that it is a lack of  
support rather than a nicety.** Without it, four sites in `t_queue.c3` and  
`t_mailbox.c3` holding an `Inner*` off a `pop_front` would have been exempted  
from Rule 8 on its first use, for a reason that is not a real one.

**Rule 8 is written, in both files, and the stage rules moved again.**  
`3tk-rules-006.md` carries it at the end of Part 1, in Rule 6's voice —  
defeasible by subject, a sentence at the site, the three qualifying shapes named,  
and Rule 6's own refusal of a grep quoted as this rule's. **Stage rules 8-13  
became 9-14, the third such shift**, and the header now says a citation resolves  
by adding one **per shift**. `3tk-example-rules-006.md` carries the other half:  
the promise it makes about `test/` now names the file that keeps it and the count  
that proves it — all ten remaining callers of the five part-1 methods are in  
`t_identity.c3`. **Both superseded versions went to `matryoshka-3tk/design/backup/`  
with a plain `mv`**, Rule 14, without asking.

**`C-7` was written in this stage rather than left to `3TK-76`.** The plan lists  
it under both stages' steps; writing it once, here, is what step 5 says, and  
`3TK-76`'s step 4 is spent by it. **The next stage checks the wording rather than  
writing it.**

**The books were revised, and one is a new version.** `3tk-reference-010.md` →  
**`011`** — Rule 14, more than a sentence: *The other three*, the boundaries  
paragraph and *Usual flow*'s stamp sentence all changed, and the header carries  
why the write went rather than being narrowed. `010` is in that repo's `backup/`.  
**`3tk-api-005.md` and `3tk-decisions-007.md` were revised in place**, which  
their own headers ask for. **Every `helper.c3:` citation in both was re-resolved  
against the built tree**: the file is +5 lines at `inner` and +9 at `linked`, so  
everything past line 160 moved down by fourteen, and the one citation *inside*  
that range — the decisions record's pointer at the `inner` declaration itself —  
was re-resolved by hand to `helper.c3:171` rather than shifted.

**Link re-anchoring, and where the line was drawn.** Every live reference to  
`3tk-reference-010.md`, `3tk-rules-005.md` and `3tk-example-rules-005.md` was  
re-pointed — two scripts, `ref/3tk-doc-loop-005.md`, and the three books in  
`matryoshka-3tk/design/`. **A one-token link re-anchor is not "more than a  
sentence"**, so `3tk-doc-loop-005.md` was edited in place and did not become  
`006`. **`3tk-log.md` and `3tk-staging-plan-036.md` were left alone**: the log is  
append-only, and the plan's citations were correct against the file they were  
written against — which is exactly what the rules header says about live text and  
a shifted number.

**Rule 12, the script and CI port.** `run-builds.sh` is the one script the stage  
changed, and it was carried across; `diff` against `matryoshka-3tk/scripts/` is  
the `ROOT` line alone, as it must be. The other three ported scripts were  
diffed too and needed nothing. **The `.yml` files needed nothing, and this is the  
answer written down**: `linux.yml` is a build-and-test matrix that runs no  
negative, so two new negative programs do not reach it.

**Not done, deliberately.** `stamp` was not narrowed — `C-3`, and its three  
callers are all construction-time. `examples/` was not touched. No guard was  
added for `test/` or `negative/`. The examples line in `docs.yml` is still  
commented, and it is still the owner's.

**The 113 sites are still there.** That is `3TK-76`, and it now has a settled  
surface to be written against.

## 2026-09-10 — the sitting that ruled white box from black box, and plan 036

**No stage, no code, and no `run-builds.sh` run.** The first sitting after  
`3TK-74` closed and `035` went spent. It was opened as a tidy-up — examples and  
tests calling `inner::internal::*` where an `OuterHelper` member exists — and it  
came out with a port rule, a `src/` defect and two stages. The rulings are  
`C-1` … `C-9` in
[3tk-staging-plan-036.md](3tk-staging-plan-036.md).

**What the measurement changed about the question.** The opening framing was  
that `examples/` and `test/` both needed cleaning and that `queue.c3`,  
`mailbox.c3` and `pool.c3` might too. **Three of those four were already  
answered.** `examples/` was cleaned by `3TK-66` and has been guarded at  
`run-builds.sh:305-313` since; `mailbox.c3` and `pool.c3` already route  
everything but one line each through their `@private` aliases; and `queue.c3`'s  
three sites are on a **type-erased `Inner*`** where no `Outer` is in scope, so no  
binding can exist to call. **The real population was `test/` 98 and `negative/`  
15, and nothing in `src/` was convertible.**

**The `src/` defect was found by pulling on the two exceptions rather than  
accepting them.** `mailbox.c3:48-52` and `pool.c3:160-164` each justify a raw  
`to_inner` on the ground that the helper's `inner()` stamps and *"a stamp writes  
the same bytes it finds, but it writes them."* **That sentence is true of the  
typeid half and understates the other one.** `Inner` is a single `any`: the  
pointer half is the chain link. `stamp` rebuilds the whole field —  
`any_make(inner.link.ptr, …)` — so it **reads the link and writes it back**, and  
a concurrent relink is lost. **`HS-10` ruled the stamp writes `.type` only; the  
built code never did.** The two exceptions were the two places that had noticed  
and stepped around it.

**The owner's ruling was to remove the write rather than narrow it, and the  
reason is that the door is redundant.** `OuterHelper.stamp` already exists for  
the one case `inner()`'s stamp covered — an outer allocated by hand — so the  
toolkit's story is complete at two moments: `create` stamps what it makes,  
`stamp` stamps what you made. **The session had proposed probing a `.type`-only  
write first; the owner's route is smaller and needs no probe.** `MS-8` is the  
standing warning about confident `any` spellings. What replaces the stamp is a  
safe-build check — **`mtk::@check` plus `is_mine`, both already in the source,  
both read-only** — which catches a forgotten stamp *and* a wrong-typed one and  
compiles to nothing in a release build.

**Three measurements did most of the deciding.**
- **`OuterHelper.inner` has seven call sites in the whole tree and all seven are
  in `test/t_helper.c3`.** The convenience door was used by nothing but its own  
  test, which is what made removing it cheap.
- **Stamping happens at four sites and three are construction-time.** That is
  why `C-3` leaves `stamp` itself alone: its remaining callers cannot race.
- **The five part-1 methods have ten callers left in `test/` and all ten are in
  `t_identity.c3`.** `3tk-example-rules-005.md` let `examples/` drop those five  
  *"because all five methods keep callers there"*. **A blanket pass over `test/`  
  would have broken that promise silently**, and the file that keeps it is  
  white box on its own subject anyway. The two rules agree; `C-7` writes it  
  down so the agreement is not re-derived.

**The rule the owner gave, and where it goes.** *If the source cannot do its  
functionality without accessing internals — and it is not a lack of support — it  
continues to use internals: white box; otherwise black box, use the wrappers.*  
**The second clause is what makes it usable**: a site that cannot reach the  
helper because the helper is missing a member is a gap, and the stage adds the  
member. `OuterHelper.linked` is the worked example — it takes an `Outer*`, four  
sites hold an `Inner*` after a pop, and `C-4` gives it the same `$Typeof`  
dispatch `look` already has rather than exempting them.

**A guard was proposed and withdrawn on Rule 6's own words.** The session  
suggested extending the `examples/` grep to `test/` and `negative/`. **Rule 6  
already refuses exactly that** — *"A grep cannot tell necessity from history; it  
would need an allow-list, and the allow-list would be the judgment restated in a  
shell script, where a reader of the test never sees it."* The `examples/` guard  
survives only because the examples rule is **absolute**; this one is defeasible,  
so the sentence at the site is the enforcement.

**Why two stages rather than one.** `3TK-75` changes what `inner()` means and  
`3TK-76` rewrites 113 sites onto it. **Rule 10's shape, one level up:** the  
surface must be settled before the sites move, and a single stage would bury a  
concurrency change inside a hundred mechanical edits, which is where a sanitizer  
regression goes unnoticed.

**Not decided, and left to the owner:** whether `035` now moves to `backup/`.  
The status file said it stays *"until a `036` exists"* and one now does, but  
`034` is spent and kept beside it, so the pattern does not settle itself. **No  
file was moved.**

## 2026-09-09 — 3TK-74: the outer's hooks become required

**Plan [3tk-staging-plan-035.md](3tk-staging-plan-035.md), rulings `B-1` …  
`B-10`. Ran on Opus 5, as the charter asked.** `OuterHelper.create` and  
`OuterHelper.release` no longer call application code that nothing declares.  
Closed.

**The figures moved, and the two negatives are why.** `run-builds.sh` is **115  
checks, 0 failures, four builds, 145 tests in each** — 107 before, plus the two  
new compile-time negatives run once per build. `check-doc-loop.sh` is **11  
labelled blocks, 0 differing, 458 of 458 sentences, 0 banned words**, up from  
443 because the helper's module block and both member blocks grew;  
`move-module-docs.sh roundtrip` is byte-identical; `run-sanitizers.sh` is  
**3 of 3**. `src/*.c3` is **684 lines** by Rule 5's definition, unchanged as a  
figure and recomputed rather than trusted.

### What the stage did

**Every outer that `OuterHelper.create` makes now declares  
`fn void? Outer.init(&self, Allocator a)` and  
`fn void Outer.finish(&self, Allocator a)`, and an empty body is fine.**  
`B-1`. Before this, both hooks were found structurally by `$defined` and a  
misspelled name was silent: the branch vanished and the outer came back  
allocated, stamped and uninitialized, or gave up nothing on the way out.  
**Absence was the ambiguity** — no `init` meant either *this type needs none* or  
*you spelled it wrong* — and requiring the declaration is what removes it.

**`destroy` is `finish`, and it returns plain `void`.** `B-2`, `B-3`. The old  
name told the user to do the one thing that would double-free: `release` frees  
the outer the moment the hook returns. The narrowing removed a fault no caller  
could act on — `release` used to turn a `destroy` failure into  
`mtk::@check(!f, …)`, an abort in a safe build and dropped in a fast one.

**The mechanism is two `$assert`s in each of `create` and `release`, and  
nothing else.** `B-4`. Compile-time, so it is alive in every build mode,  
including `--safe=no`, which is the build where a silently-uninitialized outer  
does the most damage.

### Rule 9 was followed, and the order is what the entry records

**The asserts and one exemplar type went in first.** `Msg` in  
`test/common.c3` got both hooks with empty bodies; the rest of the tree went  
red and was watched going red before anything else was touched. **The  
diagnostic points at the user's call site** — c3c prints the failing `$assert`  
against `helper.c3`'s line and then excerpts *the caller's* source under  
*Note: Inlined from here* — which is the half a user needs and which the plan's  
2026-09-09 measurement had predicted.

**Both negatives went in before the sweep, so the sweep was measured rather  
than asserted.** `nocompile_no_init` declares `finish` correctly and spells the  
other hook **`initialize`** — the near miss, not an omission, because the  
misspelling is the failure the rule exists for. `nocompile_no_finish` declares  
`init` and no teardown hook at all. Both refuse to compile in all four builds.

**They are compile-time negatives, not tier 1, and `B-9`'s word was loose.**  
Rule 12. The suite's *tier 1* means *aborts at runtime in every mode*; a check  
that cannot compile has no runtime. `NOCOMPILE_EXPECT` is the category that  
already means *never compiles, in any mode, and the message must name what is  
wrong*, and it runs in every build, which is what `B-9` was reaching for.

**What is grepped for is the `$assert` message, not a type name.** A `$assert`  
message is a constant string and cannot carry the offending type. The compiler  
names the call site instead. **The other direction of the check — that it stays  
quiet for a type that declares both hooks — is the test suite**, green in all  
four builds and under all three sanitizer runs.

### The sweep was bigger than the charter's figure, and Rule 12 governs

**Measured: 14 outer types and 28 hooks, of which 21 were newly written and 20  
of the 28 have empty bodies.** The charter said *15 empty bodies over 12  
types*, counting `helper::OF{...}` binding sites. **Three distinct `Holder`  
types exist, in three modules** — `test/common.c3`, `examples/outers.c3` and  
`negative/create_into_full_slot.c3` — and a binding-site count collapses them  
into one. The eight hooks with a body are six `init`s that keep the allocator,  
`Picky.init` returning its fault, and `Noisy.finish` counting its call.

Where they are: `test/common.c3` 7 types, `examples/outers.c3` 3,  
`examples/023-infrastructure_wrapper.c3` 1 (`WorkerInbox`),  
`negative/common.c3` 2 and `negative/create_into_full_slot.c3` 1.

**`B-5`'s container exemption needed no code, and that is worth writing down.**  
`_Mbox` and `_Pool` bind `helper::OF{...}` for `stamp` and `look` and never  
call `create`, so the asserts never instantiate for them. **The exemption falls  
out of where the check sits** rather than out of a list the check has to  
consult, which is the difference between a line and a hole. The module block  
says so in a sentence all the same, because a reader of `mailbox.c3` cannot see  
the absence of a call.

**`t_helper.c3`'s `neither_hook_is_required` is now  
`empty_hook_bodies_are_how_a_type_says_nothing_to_do`.** The test's subject was  
the old ambiguity and could not survive `B-1`; the behaviour it checks —  
`alloc::new_try` zeroes the allocation, and that is the whole initialization —  
is unchanged and is still what it checks. `the_destroy_hook_runs_on_release` is  
`the_finish_hook_runs_on_release`.

### The documents

**`3tk-reference-010.md` replaces `009`**, Rule 13. `009` is in  
`matryoshka-3tk/design/backup/`. It carries `B-7`'s table, which is the answer  
to a question the stage decided a user asks before they ask it — *why is this  
not `PoolHooks`* — and the answer is not *these are different kinds of thing*:  
they are the same kind, an inversion in both cases, differing in **how many  
answers there are and when the answer is fixed**. A pool's hooks are policy,  
one answer per pool, chosen at `pool::create` and **passed**. An outer's are  
the type's own, one answer per type, fixed at compile time and **declared**.

**`3tk-rules-005.md` replaces `004`**, Rule 13, and it is the version that  
carries the new MUST. **New Rule 7 — every outer the helper creates declares  
both hooks** — sits at the end of Part 1, and **Rule 4's last paragraph was  
rewritten** because `B-1` deleted its premise. That paragraph refused an  
`interface OuterHooks` on the ground that both hooks were *optional*, so an  
interface would read as mandatory. **`B-6`: the ruling stands and the argument  
is replaced** — an interface carries a choice across a boundary **at runtime**,  
and these hooks are never passed; there is nothing to implement and nothing to  
hand over, so an interface would add a vtable dispatch to answer a question the  
compiler already knows. A later stage that finds the old sentence in a  
superseded version must not read the ruling as lapsed with its argument.

**The stage rules moved by one and live text was not rewritten for it.** What  
`004` numbered 7–12, `005` numbers 8–13, the way `003` shifted them when it  
added Rule 6. `005`'s header says a citation to an older number resolves by  
adding one, so **`3tk-staging-plan-035.md`'s *Rule 9 governs the order* and  
every Rule-N citation in this log stand as written**. Only `3tk-status.md` was  
re-anchored, because it is state rather than history.

**`3tk-decisions-007.md` and `3tk-api-005.md` were revised in place**, which is  
what both files' own headers ask for and what 3TK-62, 3TK-63, 3TK-64 and  
3TK-70 did before. The decisions record carries the new MUST, `B-2`'s  
narrowing, `B-3`'s rename, `B-5`'s exemption and `B-6` as a replaced argument.

**Every `helper.c3` citation in both was re-resolved against the built tree**,  
because the file moved: **+16 lines above `create`, +18 at `create`, +20 at  
`release`**. Twelve distinct anchors in the decisions record, seventeen in the  
api page, and the api page gained the two `$assert` lines and lost the  
`mtk::@check(!f, …)` that guarded the fault `B-2` removed.

**`ref/3tk-doc-loop-005.md` was re-anchored** to `3tk-reference-010.md`, and a  
sentence of its own history that named the old number was repaired rather than  
mechanically bumped into a tautology.

### Rule 11 — the scripts and the CI

**`run-builds.sh` is the only ported script this stage changed**, and the diff  
against `matryoshka-3tk/scripts/run-builds.sh` is **the `ROOT` line alone**, as  
it must be. `run-sanitizers.sh` is unchanged and its diff is the same one line.

**The `.yml` files needed no change, and that is written down because the rule  
says to write it down.** `linux.yml` is a build-and-test matrix and runs  
neither the negatives nor the doc loop, so two new compile-time negatives reach  
it not at all. `sanitizers.yml` and `docs.yml` are untouched by anything here.

**`check-doc-loop.sh` and `move-module-docs.sh` are still not in  
`matryoshka-3tk/scripts/`**, as they were not before this stage. Both had their  
`REF` line moved from `009` to `010`. Not this stage's to fix, and flagged  
rather than acted on.

**`matryoshka-3tk/src/helper.c3` and `matryoshka-3tk/test/t_helper.c3` still  
carry the old text.** 3tk `.c3` sources are edited only in `matryoshka-tk`'s  
copy and the owner copies them across; the stage did not touch them.

## 2026-09-09 — 3TK-73: the design-folder audit

**Plan [3tk-staging-plan-034.md](3tk-staging-plan-034.md), rulings `A-1` … `A-14`.  
Ran on Opus 5, as the charter asked.** Sixteen documents and one script in  
`design/secondary/lang/c3/` read and classified into stays / moves / retires.  
**Five stay, two crossed to `matryoshka-3tk/design/`, twelve retired.** No code  
was written. Closed.

**The figures did not move, which is `A-11`'s proof.** `run-builds.sh` is **107  
checks, 0 failures, four builds, 145 tests in each**; `check-doc-loop.sh` is  
**11 labelled blocks, 0 differing, 443 of 443 sentences, 0 banned words**;  
`move-module-docs.sh roundtrip` is byte-identical; `run-sanitizers.sh` is **3 of  
3**. Identical to 3TK-72's in every figure.

**Rule 10, and the answer is none needed — written down because the rule says  
an answer must be.** No script changed in this stage, the four ported scripts  
still differ from this repo's copies only in the `ROOT` line, and none of  
`linux.yml`, `docs.yml` or `sanitizers.yml` names any document this stage  
touched.

### What crossed, and why

**`c3-capabilities-003.md`** — `A-4`. The twelve questions, the verified  
spellings and the two naming hazards are what C3 does, and the port's reader is  
who needs them. *For 3TK-5* and *What this study rules on* were **deleted, not  
carried**: the first instructed a stage that ran in 2026-08, and the second  
resolved eleven conflicts between seven drafts that no longer exist. Nothing in  
either was still true and unrecorded elsewhere — Q4 already ends by saying it  
reopens what the drafts thought closed, and the `anylist` collision is in the  
spellings table. **One word of `A-4` overturned, under `A-13`:** its survivor  
list omits *What Matryoshka gains, and what it still pays*, and that section is  
evergreen by `A-4`'s own criterion — it says what C3 gives and costs and names  
no stage — so it crossed. **The toolchain was re-measured first and had not  
moved: 0.8.3, git `1d155ee`, LLVM 22.1.8**, which is the sentence `A-4` asks for  
rather than a silence. Six markers into deleted documents (`C1` … `C7` "of the  
review") were rewritten as what they mean, and `C7` — *stays open* — was  
**closed against the decisions record**, which rules both halves of the  
allocator question.

**`3tk-port-findings-005.md`** — `A-7`, and the ruling is **the two are  
genuinely different subjects, so it moves as it is.** `3tk-decisions-007.md`  
says of itself *it accumulates; it does not argue — an entry says what stands,  
not the case that was made for it*; the findings document is nothing but the  
case, four parts per section, with what ztk does beside it. Neither does the  
other's job, and retiring either would lose something the other never held.

### The two bugs files, which were most of the stage

**`3tk-bugs-pool.md` and `3tk-bugs- mailbox.md`, 2,916 lines, read in full —  
`A-9`. The expectation held: no live defect in either.** Every *must fix* in the  
pool file's §29 is the `Q5` lifetime item, ruled 2026-08-28 and built by 3TK-53  
and 3TK-54. Everything else is either endorsement of what the port already does  
— §18 through §24 and §28, the flat bucket array, `broadcast` over `signal`, the  
`extra` mechanism, `UNKNOWN_IDENTITY` as a defect — or the *release waits for  
active callers* model **the owner overturned**: the port asserts quiet rather  
than waiting for it. The mailbox file's §2 and §15 argue for dropping *release  
requires closed*; that was refused as `Q-B` and the rule stands. Both are  
history, and both retired. **The name lost its space on the way**:  
`backup/3tk-bugs-mailbox.md`.

### Two findings the stage made and did not fix

**`P4` is closed, and reading the code is what closed it.** The audit's finding  
— the pool's leaver signals on one bucket over a condition variable shared by  
*n*, against Part 2.6 — names a branch that no longer exists.  
`grep -n 'signal()' src/pool.c3` returns nothing: every wake the pool performs  
is a `broadcast`, and `Pool.get_wait`'s timeout path leaves without signalling  
at all. It went with 3TK-70's removal of the two vacuous Part 2.6 signals. What  
used to be the reason nothing was ever lost is now the whole mechanism.  
**Recorded in the status, in `3tk-decisions-007.md` and in §9 of the findings  
document, which is the version that says so.**

**`P3` is still live, and it was carried out of a document that retired the  
same day.** The status cited `3tk-deviations-001.md` for it, and `backup/` is  
not a source of truth, so `P3` is now **written out in full in the status** —  
what it is, both sites, and why its severity is only that the next port copies  
the shape. Both sites now carry the reason in the code as a trailing comment,  
which they did not when the audit found it. **Nothing live cites that file any  
more.**

**And one small thing, reported and not fixed, because this stage writes no  
code:** `_Mbox.has_queued` — `mailbox.c3:432` — has no readers anywhere in  
`src/`. Its last one was the vacuous Part 2.6 signal 3TK-70 removed. It is a  
declaration with nothing behind it, not a defect.

### Two items outside 3tk, raised in 2026-08 and still open

**`3tk-on-close-policy-001.md` §5 named two, and both are still there**, checked  
2026-09-09 before that file retired. `design/matryoshka-api-reference-042.md`  
still says *"The pool calls it once, with the full list"*, which contradicts  
Part 12.2's *called once by close, and once more per straggling put*. And  
`matryoshka-specification-005.md` Part 12.3 still cites *3tk: `pool.c3:445-480`*  
for a window that has moved twice since. **Reported, not fixed**: both are the  
shared books, and neither is 3tk's to rule on.

### The rest of the classification

**`3tk-release-while-busy-001.md` retires — `A-14`, and nothing in it is  
unbuilt.** It called itself *a deferred item, not yet scheduled*, and the  
ruling of 2026-08-28 is the whole of what it asked for: the hazard is enforced  
by `_active` in both tools, the shared clause it deferred was written by 3TK-52  
as Part 11.12 *closed and quiet*, and `3tk-lifetime-fix-005.md` says outright  
that it supersedes this file. Its interim `W3` warning was to be written out  
again when enforcement landed, and enforcement landed. **Nothing goes to the  
status from it.**

**`3tk-build-dist.md` folds and retires — `A-8`, and the stage took the fold  
rather than the move.** It is language material, but it is 2026-08-23 prose  
written in the second person around a proposed `project.json` the port never  
used, and crossing it beside twelve measured probes would have put unmeasured  
recommendations into a study whose whole standard is *this was compiled and  
run*. **Q13 was rebuilt from the compiler instead** — `c3c --help` and  
`c3c init-lib` on 0.8.3 — and it found two things the original did not say: a  
`manifest.json` carries `//` comments, and the one c3c generates ends its  
`targets` object with a trailing comma. A strict JSON parser rejects what the  
compiler wrote.

**`3tk-sanitizer-notes-001.md` stays — `A-6`, first branch.** What is load  
bearing in it is this machine and this repository: Fedora ships no `libtsan`,  
`--cc clang` is the way in and needs no root, `run-sanitizers.sh` exits 2 rather  
than 0 on a skip. A document only a session reads does not cross. Its  
port-facing half is the recommendation `A-6` bars, and what would survive being  
rewritten as description is already carried by Part 12.3 and by the decisions  
record. Its header sentence *what a later port should copy* was reworded so the  
file stops advertising a recommendation it does not make, and its measured line  
numbers were **left as measured** — re-pointing a measurement falsifies it.

**`ref/3tk-doc-loop-005.md`** — stays, and Rule 12 versioned it because more  
than a sentence changed: five citations to `3tk-reference-005.md` were four  
versions behind, and two links named `3tk-staging-plan-016.md`, which is not in  
this folder at all. The rule that plan held — *a description is moved, never  
composed* — is now stated where it is used instead of pointed at.

**The four short ones were confirmed, not overturned.** `3tk-open-defects.md`  
(ten items, eight fixed, zero open), `3tk-on-close-policy-001.md` (*fixed the  
same day*, its own words), `3tk-on-close-handoff-001.md` (`P6`'s charter, built  
2026-08-30) and `3tk-debts-notes-001.md` (3TK-15's two debts, discharged). So  
were the two long ones: `3tk-lifetime-fix-005.md`, built, whose own §14 still  
lists `Q-D` as open where the status records it built; and  
`3tk-deviations-001.md`, 3TK-12's measurement of a tree since rebuilt, against  
a specification now in `common/backup/`.

**`reapply_decisions.py` retires, and it was not in the plan's table.** A  
one-off restore script that `3tk-decisions-007.md` calls spent. `A-2` says every  
file lands in a bucket, so it was named to the owner and moved with the rest.

### The definition this stage fixed rather than halting on

**Rule 11, and it is the only place the stage read outside `design/`.** `A-11`  
says `src/` is not opened; `A-10` says whatever survives has its citations  
re-anchored. The findings document carries about forty `file:line` citations  
into a tree that 3TK-63, 3TK-64 and 3TK-70 rewrote after it was written, and  
publishing them stale is the defect `A-10` names. **So `src/` was read,  
read-only, and nothing in it was written** — `A-11`'s actual guarantee is that  
no figure moves and no code is touched, and the four scripts prove both.  
`Handle` became `Inner*` in every quoted block, `stack.c3` and `managed.c3` are  
gone, `@check` moved to `mtk.c3`, and the identity write moved from  
`helper::init` to `inner::internal::stamp`. **ztk's citations were not re-read  
and were not touched**, and the document says so.

### Reported under Part 5, and then fixed

**Banned words in the two documents that crossed**, because they left a folder  
the scan skips for one it does not. Reported first, as Part 5 requires; **the  
owner approved the same day and the pass ran** — nine words across the two, in  
prose only.

**Quoted source was not touched**, and that is the part worth writing down: the  
remaining matches for the scan pattern are all `self._mu.unlock()` and  
`p.*.mutex.unlock(io)` inside `c3` and `zig` blocks. **A word inside quoted  
code is the code, not the document's prose**, and rewriting it would falsify a  
measurement — the same reason this stage left the sanitizer notes' line numbers  
where they were. Both documents carry an amended changelog row saying a pass  
ran, without naming what it removed.

## 2026-09-09 — 3TK-72: the example groups

**Plan [3tk-staging-plan-033.md](backup/3tk-staging-plan-033.md), rulings `G-1` … `G-9`.  
Ran on Opus 5, as the charter asked.** `examples/` is eleven groups. An example  
declares `module shc::<group>::<name>;`, each group has a carrier file  
`<group>.c3` describing it and declaring nothing, and **no file was renamed and  
no code moved.** Closed.

**The figures did not move, which is the proof `G-8` asked for.**  
`run-builds.sh` is **107 checks, 0 failures, four builds, 145 tests in each**.  
`check-doc-loop.sh` is **11 labelled blocks, 0 differing, 443 of 443 sentences,  
0 banned words**, `move-module-docs.sh roundtrip` is byte-identical, and  
`run-sanitizers.sh` is **3 of 3**. Identical to `3TK-71`'s in every figure, which  
is what a grouping stage is entitled to and the only thing that proves it moved  
nothing.

**Why the site needed this.** `c3c docgen` groups by module and by nothing else,  
so 52 flat `shc::` modules were 52 sibling pages in alphabetical order —  
`available_only` beside `close_recovery` beside `defer_put_early`. The structure  
existed already, in the `##` sections of the catalog and in the number each file  
carries. This stage put it where docgen can see it.

**The eleven, in reading order:** `a_slot_and_transfer` (001, 003, 004),  
`b_cleanup` (005–010), `c_crossing` (011, 012, 013, 015, 016), `d_dispatch`  
(017–020), `e_infrastructure` (023–026), `f_mailbox` (027–032), `g_topology`  
(033–036), `h_pool` (037–040, 042, 045), `i_shutdown` (046), `j_coordinator`  
(049–053), `k_new_in_3tk` (057–061). **49 example files carry a group**, and  
`outers.c3`, `helpers.c3` and `shc.c3` stay at the top level by `G-6`.

**`b_cleanup` is the owner's, and it is the one place the grouping leaves the  
catalog.** The catalog's first section is two subjects — three files of Slot  
mechanics and six of cleanup — and the reference book already separates them,  
with *Cleanup patterns* a heading of its own in Part 6. **The catalog was not  
rewritten**, and `G-5` says why: it is descriptive, and the grouping is not.

**The letter prefix is not decoration.** A C3 module segment cannot start with a  
digit, so the catalog order the file names carry as `001`, `003`, `005` cannot be  
carried by the module. `a_` … `k_` carries it instead, on the group segment  
only: **the leaf keeps its plain name**, because the number is in the file name  
and that is where `G-2` keeps it.

**The probe of `G-7` answered yes, and the second half of it is why the answer  
is trustworthy.** `import shc;` reaches two levels of submodule, so  
`test/t_examples.c3`'s **52 leaf imports became one line**. The stage then  
deleted that line too, and c3c refused with *"Did you mean the function  
`shc::a_slot_and_transfer::insert_from_slot::insert_from_a_slot` … please add  
`import shc::a_slot_and_transfer::insert_from_slot`"* — so the one import is  
doing the work, not the fully-qualified call site resolving on its own.  
**A later stage does not re-run this probe.** The file now gains no import when  
a group gains a file.

**Two things the plan had wrong, both corrected in the stage under `G-9`.**

- **The sweep was 103 references, not 52.** Every wrapper calls its example
  fully qualified — `shc::<name>::fn(...)` — so each example needed its group  
  segment at the call site as well as at the import. The plan counted imports  
  and stopped there. A build caught it immediately: *"'insert_from_a_slot' could  
  not be found, try importing the 'shc::insert_from_slot' module."*
- **The two imports between example files are 018 → 017 and 045 → 018**, not
  the 019/020 pair the plan named. Both swept correctly, because the sweep  
  matched on the module name rather than on the file the plan guessed.  
  **`045` is a cross-group import** — `h_pool` reaching into `d_dispatch` for  
  `CreateByIdentityHooks` — which is catalog entry 45 reusing entry 18's hooks  
  deliberately. **A group is not a wall**, and `3tk-example-rules-005.md` now  
  says so, so no later stage reads that import as a layering defect.

**A third thing, and it cost a wasted twenty minutes.** `run-builds.sh` exists  
in both repos and **`matryoshka-3tk`'s copy has `ROOT` pointing at its own  
tree**. Run from `matryoshka-tk`'s `3tk/` directory it silently tests the other  
repo's sources — which this stage had not touched — and it reported a `FAIL`  
that was nothing but two overlapping runs sharing one `out/testrun` (*"Text file  
busy"*). **The tree's own `run-builds.sh` is the one to run**; the `scripts/`  
copy is for running inside `matryoshka-3tk`. `run-sanitizers.sh` is the  
exception — it takes the tree as `$1`, and was run that way.

**`3tk-example-rules-005.md` replaces `004`**, `004` to  
`matryoshka-3tk/design/backup/`. Two rules: *The file name* now reads  
`NNN-name.c3`, declaring `module shc::<group>::<name>;`, and its bullet on why  
the file name and the module name differ names both reasons — the digit and the  
group segment. **New section *The groups*** — a group is a submodule with a  
carrier file that declares nothing, the prefix is what orders the groups on the  
generated page, a group is not a wall, adding a group is adding a file, and a  
stage may split a catalog section and says so. The five live references in  
`3tk-patterns-004.md` and the rules file were re-anchored.

**`3tk-rules-004.md` replaces `003`, and it is the owner's ruling of the same  
day.** New **Rule 12 — a document is versioned, not asked about**: when a  
document a stage touches needs more than a sentence changed, the stage writes the  
new version and moves the old to `backup/`, in the stage and **without asking**.  
A new version of an existing document is not a new document, so the standing  
*ask before creating a file in `matryoshka-3tk/design/`* does not reach it.  
**It was ruled because this stage halted to ask exactly that** — whether `004`  
could become `005` — and the round trip bought nothing: the alternative to  
asking is editing in place, which destroys the text `backup/` was supposed to  
hold. Rules 1–11 are unchanged word for word. `003` to `backup/`; the live  
references in `3tk-decisions-007.md` and `3tk-status.md` were re-anchored, and  
the log's older entries were **not** — a log entry records what was true when it  
was written.

**Scripts and CI needed nothing, and Rule 10 says to write that down.**  
`run-builds.sh` names `examples/` by **file name** only — the `ALLOWED=` pair  
and the layering `grep` beside it — and `G-2` kept every file name, so both  
repos' copies are untouched and still differ only in `ROOT`. The doc-loop  
scripts read `src/` alone; `examples/` is outside the doc loop entirely. **The  
three `.yml` files needed no change**: `linux.yml` builds and tests inline and  
names no module, and `docs.yml` names no module either.

**But `docs.yml` was read properly and it holds a finding the stage did not go  
looking for: the published docs site does not include `examples/` at all.**  
Its step runs `c3c docgen --emit-stdlib=no src`, and the line that would add the  
examples is **commented out one line below it** —  
`# run: c3c docgen --emit-stdlib=no src examples` — while the workflow's `paths:`  
filter still triggers on `examples/**`, so a change there rebuilds a site the  
change cannot appear in. **This stage's grouping is therefore correct and  
invisible**: it is what the site would show, the moment that line is  
uncommented. Uncommenting it publishes 63 new modules and is the owner's call,  
not the stage's, so it was left exactly as found and raised instead.

**`c3-capabilities-002.md` replaces `001`**, `001` to this folder's `backup/`,  
and it is **Rule 12's first use** — the version was written in the stage, not  
asked about. The owner asked a question about `Mailbox.create`'s  
`defer catch mb._mu.destroy();` — why it sits after the `init` and not before —  
and the answer turned out to be a capability the study never recorded — though  
`MANUAL.md` §6_12_2 documents it plainly, so what the probe added is  
confirmation and the five refused spellings, not a discovery. **The owner  
asked for the manual to be checked, and it said what the probe said.** Q6 now  
carries the three `defer` forms, all verified together; **`defer (catch f)`**,  
which binds the fault the way Zig's `errdefer |err|` does, with the parentheses  
around `catch f` and not around the binding; the **five refused spellings** with  
c3c's own misleading messages, *Expected a type here* among them; and the `~`  
fault return. **Nothing in `mtk` or in the C3 standard library uses the bound  
form**, so this is a capability recorded, not a change owed.

**Not yet copied to `matryoshka-3tk`'s `examples`/`test`, or pushed** — that is  
the owner's step. The design documents were written directly in  
`matryoshka-3tk/design/`.

## 2026-09-09 — 3TK-71: the tests allocate their outers

**Plan [3tk-staging-plan-032.md](3tk-staging-plan-032.md), rulings `T-1` … `T-11`.  
Ran on Opus 5, as the charter asked.** Every outer in `test/` and `negative/` is  
allocated through `OuterHelper.create` now, bar four sites whose subject forbids  
it, and each of those four says so at the site. Closed.

**The figures did not move, which is the proof `T-10` asked for.**  
`run-builds.sh` is **107 checks, 0 failures, four builds, 145 tests in each**.  
`check-doc-loop.sh` is **11 labelled blocks, 0 differing, 443 of 443 sentences,  
0 banned words**, and `move-module-docs.sh roundtrip` is byte-identical over all  
eleven. No test was added or removed. **`run-sanitizers.sh` is 3 of 3 clean** —  
and it was not clean the first time it ran; see below.

### The count the plan carried was not the count on disk

**The plan counted 41 stack outers in `test/` and 12 in `negative/`, per  
declaration. It counted only the SCALAR declarations.** An array of outers —  
`Msg[8] ms;` — is one declaration and eight stack outers, and there were  
**nineteen such arrays**: ten in `t_queue.c3`, eight in `t_mailbox.c3`, one in  
`negative/self_move.c3`. Rule 10 as it then was, Rule 11 now: the measurement  
wins, the definition is fixed in passing, and the stage does not come back to  
ask. **Every array converted along with the scalars.**

`t_mailbox.c3`'s `Sending.outers` was the sharpest of them: three stack outers  
inside a struct, stamped and sent into a mailbox **on a worker thread**, with the  
parent frame owning the storage.

### `MsgBag`, and why the sweep did not become 150 Slots

Nineteen arrays would have become one `Slot` per element and a `defer` per Slot.  
**`test/common.c3` grew `MsgBag` instead** — `usz n` and `Slot[8]`, with  
`create(n)`, `release()` and `at(i)`. `at(i)` is exactly what `&ms[i]` was, and  
`create` numbers the outers `id = i`, which is what every ordering assertion in  
`t_queue.c3` reads. `fresh_msgs()` is gone; the bag replaced it.

### Three things the conversion found that the stack was hiding

**1. `mem` is per-thread, and an outer must be freed by the thread that  
allocated it.** `close_then_join_then_release` was converted with  
`sd.outers.create(3)` inside `sender_fn` and the release in the parent, and it  
aborted with signal 4. The outers are created in the parent's spawn loop now,  
before the thread starts. **This is written into Rule 6**, because nothing else  
in the port says it and the next test that spawns a producer will meet it again.

**2. A `defer release` must be registered BEFORE the container's `defer`, not  
after.** Defers are LIFO, so a bag declared under `defer drop_mailbox(mb)` frees  
its outers *first* and the close then walks freed memory.  
**`the_anchor_is_cleared` did exactly that, and AddressSanitizer caught it** —  
heap-use-after-free in `Inner.repoint_to` and `internal::reset`, three sanitizer  
builds red. The outer-owning declaration moved above the mailbox in every  
affected test and all three went clean.

**Neither defect was reachable while the outers were on the stack**, because a  
frame address is still readable after the outer is logically dead. That is the  
argument Stage A made in the abstract, and this is it happening.

**3. `matryoshka-3tk/scripts/run-builds.sh` still named `insert_linked_item`**, a  
negative program that was renamed to `insert_linked_outer` in this repo and never  
renamed there. The ported copy was silently checking a program that does not  
exist. Fixed in `matryoshka-3tk` — Rule 10 as it now is: **the four ported  
scripts differ only in the `ROOT` line**, and they do again.

### The four exemptions, and each says so at the site

`T-4` named three and said the list was open. **It is four.**

- `test/t_identity.c3` `uninitialized_inner_is_refused` — `create` always
  stamps, and an unstamped outer is the subject.
- `negative/unstamped_insert.c3`, `negative/unstamped_crossing.c3` — the same
  reason, at the two boundaries.
- `test/t_helper.c3` `inner_stamps_on_the_way_out` — **the one the plan did not
  list.** Its own doc block says *"an outer allocated by hand never has to be  
  stamped separately"*, so an outer `create` made is not the subject.

**Nothing else survived the question.** `t_identity.c3`'s offset probes converted  
as `T-1` and step 2 said they should; the two probes there merged with the two  
outers below them, four allocations becoming two, because the probes existed only  
to be a second unstamped pair.

### `T-7`: both globals converted, and the reason is not the lifetime

`negative/release_during_on_put.c3` and `negative/release_with_straggler_put.c3`  
declared `Msg one;` at global scope. **The lifetime argument does not reach a  
global** — its address is valid for the life of the program — so `T-7` asked for  
each to be ruled on its own. **Both convert**, and not because they were unsafe:

- Neither subject is the outer. Both are about releasing a pool while a hook is
  still inside one, and the outer is a prop.
- The outer **crosses a thread boundary into a pool**, which is the shape a
  reader of a negative program copies.
- Global was never a decision. It is where the outer went when a frame outer
  would have looked wrong — the historic reason `T-1` is about.

In the aborting builds `main` never returns, and in the fast builds the program  
exits with the outer unfreed. That was true of the global too; freeing it is not  
what either program proves.

### A defect of `3TK-70` was sitting in the baseline

**`run-builds.sh` was 106 of 107 before this stage touched anything.** Three  
declarations in `::internal` modules carried no doc block at all —  
`_Mbox.send_at`, `_Pool.take_back`, `_Pool.take_back_inner` — which Rule 2  
forbids without exception. **Fixed first, so the stage had a green baseline to  
measure against**, and it is the only line of `src/` this stage wrote. It moved  
no sentence: the marker is excluded from the doc loop by exact match, and 443  
stayed 443.

### `c3fmt` ran on `src/` mid-stage, and the doc loop refused it

**The owner ran `c3fmt`, at 14:36:37.** The stage did not know that at the time  
and reported it as damage from outside the session; **that was wrong, and this  
paragraph is the correction.** What the formatter did: spaces to tabs, doc blocks  
re-wrapped at about 120 columns, single-line `if` bodies expanded to braces,  
signatures split one parameter per line, and the *Little-endian imports* banners  
deleted with their imports moved under them.

**The doc loop refused it, and the numbers are the finding: 4 module blocks  
`DIFFERS` and 453 descriptor sentences instead of 443.** A wrapped continuation  
line is counted as a sentence of its own, and a wrapped block no longer matches  
its labelled block in `3tk-reference-009.md`. This is a genuine conflict between  
`c3fmt` and the doc loop, not a formatting preference.

**The stage restored `src/` from `matryoshka-3tk/src/`, byte-identical to the  
pre-`c3fmt` state, and re-applied the three doc blocks** — 0 differing and 443  
again, which is what says the restore was exact. **No git was used: it is the  
owner's, always.** But the restore undid an action the owner had taken  
deliberately, and a stage should establish that before reverting six files it  
did not write.

**Ruled by the owner the same day, once told: leave `src/` unformatted.** Written  
into `3tk-rules-003.md` under Rule 4, beside the sentence that says  
`check-doc-loop.sh` diffs every module block — **a stage that wants the source  
formatted answers the doc loop first.**

### The rules file, and the renumbering

**`3tk-rules-003.md`**, `002` to `matryoshka-3tk/design/backup/`. **Rule 6 is new  
and it is a PORT rule**, at the end of Part 1: *an outer in `test/` or  
`negative/` is heap-allocated through the helper, unless the test's subject  
forbids it — and then the site says so.* It carries the pattern, the four  
exemptions, the per-thread allocator fact, and `T-6`'s argument for why no check  
enforces it. **The five stage rules renumbered 6–10 into 7–11.**

**`T-9`'s three citations resolved to two edits.** Each was resolved from the  
rule's own text and never from the number it carried:

- `3tk-status.md`, *"the basis in `Rule 7` governs"* → **Rule 8**, the model rule.
- `3tk-status.md`, 3TK-70's row, *"— Rule 10"* → **Rule 11**, *fix the
  definition*, marked with the number 3TK-70 cited so the row stays readable as  
  history.
- `3tk-status.md`, *"Rule 5 carries `L-9`'s sharpened wording"* — **Rule 5 did
  not move.** The new rule went in after it, so Part 1's numbering is untouched.  
  The sentence is reworded to say so rather than left to be re-checked.
- The plan's third citation, `3tk-staging-plan-030.md`'s `L-9`, **is in
  `backup/`** and backup is transient, so it is not a live citation and was not  
  edited.

Every pointer that says *this is the rules file* now says `003`, in  
`3tk-status.md` and in `3tk-decisions-007.md`. The two sentences that record what  
3TK-70 itself produced still name `002`, because they are history and it is  
accurate.

### Rule 10 — the scripts and the CI

**One script change, and it is the `insert_linked_item` rename above.** The four  
ported scripts differ only in the `ROOT` line. `check-doc-loop.sh` and  
`move-module-docs.sh` are this repo's only and were not touched.

**The three `.yml` files needed no change, and that is written here because Rule  
10 says "none needed" is an answer that must be.** `linux.yml` is a build-and-test  
matrix and this stage added no file, flag or target; `docs.yml` runs docgen over  
`src/`, which is unchanged; `sanitizers.yml` runs the same suite, which now  
exercises real allocation and free — a gain, and it needs nothing said to it.

## 2026-09-09 — 3TK-70: the module split, and the hooks page

**Plan [3tk-staging-plan-031.md](3tk-staging-plan-031.md), rulings `M-1` … `M-8`.  
Ran on Opus 5, as the charter asked.** Six module names are eleven, over the same  
six files. Closed.

**The figures. `run-builds.sh` is 107 checks, 0 failures, four builds, 145 tests  
in each — every per-build figure identical to 3TK-68's.** The check count did not  
move, and the plan expected it might: the module-list check went from six  
per-file greps to six per-file *ordered-list* comparisons, and the partition  
block kept its one check and its six banner assertions. Two checks went red on  
the correct change and were moved in the same pass, exactly as the plan said they  
would — the module list, and the partition check. **`check-doc-loop.sh` is 11  
labelled blocks, 0 differing, 443 of 443 sentences, 0 banned words, roundtrip  
byte-identical over all eleven.**

### Step 0 — the probe, and the answer is yes

**`M-8`: a non-generic submodule under the generic `mtk::helper` renders  
sanely.** Written in a scratch directory with nothing under `3tk/` touched, the  
way 3TK-61 ran its four. `gtk::helper::sub` compiles, is callable from the  
generic parent, and docgen gives it **a page of its own with `is_generic: false`  
and its own description**, while the parent stays `is_generic: true`. No generic  
parameter leaks onto the child. **It gates nothing here — `M-6` puts no submodule  
under the helper — and it is recorded so a later stage does not re-probe it.**

### The two visibility facts the split turned on, and both were measured

**A `@private` declaration in a submodule is NOT visible to its parent.** The  
compiler says so — *"The struct 'Hidden' in gtk::inner::internal is '@private'  
and not visible from other modules"*. That decided `M-5` in one direction:  
`_Mbox` and `_Pool` **lost `@private`**, because `mtk::mailbox` and `mtk::pool`  
cast to them on the first line of every public method. `inner_offset` lost its  
`module mtk::inner @private;` section for the same reason. **`InnerStack` kept  
`@local`**, because the stack and every caller of it are in the one section.  
**No new attribute was added anywhere.**

**A parent reaches its child without an import; a cousin needs one.** `mtk::inner`  
writes `internal::from_inner(...)` with no import at all. `mtk::queue::internal`  
reaches `mtk::inner::internal` because `import mtk;` brings a module and every  
submodule of it. **Each new section got its own import block**, at the foot of the  
section in the file's little-endian style — that was the plan's named silent  
hazard, since a section's imports are its own and `pool.c3`'s single bottom block  
would otherwise have belonged to the last section only.

### Step 1 — the exemplar, and it was negative-tested both ways

**Rule 8, and it caught nothing this time, which is what a tested check looks  
like.** The partition check was rewritten to key on **which module section a  
declaration is in** rather than on its position relative to the banner, and  
`queue.c3` alone was converted. The check then went **red on 31 declarations  
across the three unswept files** and green on `queue.c3`. Both directions were  
then broken deliberately: a marked declaration moved into the public section  
reported `queue.c3:54:marked-and-outside-an-internal-module`, and an unmarked one  
in the internal section reported  
`queue.c3:205:in-an-internal-module-and-unmarked`.

**The module is strictly stronger than the position, and Rule 3 now says why.** A  
banner is a comment — renameable, duplicable, deletable — so a check keyed on it  
has to assert its own boundary first or it quietly greps nothing. A declaration  
cannot fail to be in a module section. **The banner stays as a section header for  
a human reader and is still asserted by name; it is no longer the truth.**

### Steps 2 and 4 — the sweep, and the cost the plan measured wrong

**`inner.c3` is two parts, not three.** The old part 3 folded into  
`mtk::inner::internal`. `mailbox.c3` and `queue.c3` are two sections, `pool.c3`  
is three, in the order `M-4` ruled: `mtk::pool::hooks`, `mtk::pool`,  
`mtk::pool::internal` — the hooks section opens the file the way  
`std::atomic::types` opens `atomic.c3`.

**The qualification sweep is 221 sites, not the ~35 the plan estimated. Rule 10:  
the measurement wins.** The plan's `examples/` figure was exactly right — **two  
lines**, `010-no_raw_allocator_call.c3` and `012-type_crossing.c3`, both already  
the allow-listed layering pair — and its `test/` figure was low by an order of  
magnitude: `t_queue.c3` 63, `t_identity.c3` 43, `t_mailbox.c3` 27, `t_slot.c3`  
20, `t_concurrency.c3` 4, `t_pool.c3` 4. `src/` is 28 and `negative/` is 29. The  
sweep was mechanical and the compiler is the check, so the size cost nothing; the  
number is recorded because the next stage that estimates one of these should  
estimate from a grep and not from a reading.

**Zero call sites changed for the ~16 method declarations and for `PoolHooks`**,  
exactly as the plan predicted: a method is found through its receiver type, and a  
type identifier needs no module prefix.

### Step 3 — `mtk::pool::hooks`, and a correction to `M-2`

**`M-2` said the four-clause charter was prose in `mtk::pool`'s module block. It  
was not** — it was in `PoolHooks`'s own declaration block, at `pool.c3:47-50`.  
**Rule 10: the measurement wins and the stage says so here.** The charter moved  
from the declaration block into `mtk::pool::hooks`'s module block, which is what  
`M-2` was reaching for: the charter is the module's subject, and `PoolHooks`'s  
own block is now one line — *Three methods. Implement them to give a pool its  
policy.*

**One sentence did migrate out of `mtk::pool`'s block**, and it is the one that  
was a contract on user code: *The implementing struct is the context. There is no  
`ctx` parameter.* `mtk::pool`'s block gained *`mtk::pool::hooks` is what you  
implement; this module is what you call.* in its place. **Nothing was deleted, and  
the clean doc loop proves it.**

**The new module block says out loud what the toolkit had never said anywhere:  
*This is where your code runs inside the toolkit.***

### Step 5 — the marks: 60 classified, 11 gone, 49 stand

**Ruled from the code each mark sits on, never from the number it carries**, and  
the plan's two-way split needed a third finding.

- **The eight `[3tk: Q-8, Part 5.2]` marks go**, whole lines. All eight sit on a
  `check_stamped` call. Specification `5.2` is *"What it is not"* — identity is  
  not a string or an index — which has nothing to do with those lines; Boundaries  
  `5.2` was *"The safe-build identity check — at both boundaries"*, which is  
  exactly what they do. The reason is not lost: it is in `check_stamped`'s own  
  comment and in the abort message.
- **`A3`, `D6` and `P1` also go, and the plan did not name them.** It named `Q-`,
  `R-` and `V-` as Boundaries ids and left these three unclassified. Resolved:  
  they are ids of `3tk-drafts-review-001.md`, which is in `backup/` in this  
  folder — **a transient directory, so exactly the same defect as a Boundaries  
  citation.** The finding is that the test is not *which document* but *is the  
  document live*.
- **Three marks were the whole comment** — `A3` twice and `R12` once — and each
  became plain words carrying the reason, per `M-7`. The rest were mixed and lost  
  only the dead id.
- **49 marks stand, every one resolving to a live specification Part**, and each
  was checked against the code it sits on rather than assumed: `9.2 rule 3` seven  
  times on *an acquisition asserts the Slot is empty on entry*, `11.12` nine  
  times on the closed-and-quiet sites, and so on.

### Step 6 — `mtk::helper`, and the hooks module that is refused

**`M-6` stands and the block says it.** `mtk::helper`'s module description now  
names `init` and `destroy`, their exact signatures, their optionality, that  
nothing is registered and there is no interface to implement, and **the  
silent-misspelling hazard**: a wrong signature or return type is loud because the  
branch compiles and then fails, a wrong *name* is silent because `$defined`  
answers false and the branch vanishes. `Init`, `initialize` and `deinit` are named  
as the near misses. **This stage documents; the compile-time guard is still a  
candidate stage and nobody owes it.**

### Step 7 — the books, and one thing the plan did not foresee

**`3tk-reference-009.md`**, `008` to `matryoshka-3tk/design/backup/` by plain  
`mv`. Part 7's module table is eleven rows, the six new blocks are in, and the  
*not a container library* sentence is corrected in both places it stands — it now  
reads *Not a container library, though `InnerQueue` is public and yours to use*,  
which INTR 11 raised.

**`3tk-rules-002.md`**, `001` to that repo's `backup/`. **Rule 3's truth moved  
from position to module and its argument changed with it** — `001` argued from  
*C3 ignores `@private` on a method*, and the answer is now *they are on their own  
page*, with `std::core::cpudetect` as the standard library's precedent. **Rule 4  
gained `M-3`'s direction criterion** and the *inversion with nothing to declare  
gets no module* clause. **Rule 2's *no prose in an internal block* is restated as  
a ruling with its reason**, and with the consequence written down: a declaration  
may carry an example if and only if it is not in an `::internal` module.

**The doc-loop tooling had to be widened, and the plan did not say so.** The  
verification asked for *5 labelled blocks → 11*, and 11 was not reachable:  
`doc_blocks.py` found **one** module per file, by matching `module X;`. Two  
changes, both in `doc_blocks.py` and its two readers: the walk is over **sections  
rather than files**, and the module pattern accepts a trailing `<...>` and a  
trailing `@attr`. The second closes a wart 3TK-pre-65 recorded and nobody owned —  
**`mtk::helper`'s description is a labelled block now**, diffed like every other,  
where it had been prose checked sentence by sentence because a generic module line  
was not the shape the parser knew. Neither script is ported to `matryoshka-3tk`,  
so Rule 9 is untouched by it.

**The citations were re-anchored, and the anchors changed shape.** 230 in  
`3tk-decisions-007.md` and 90 in `3tk-api-005.md`, each resolved from its own  
entry's text against the current tree — the api table quotes the contract or check  
clause verbatim, so those resolved by searching for the clause, and the decisions  
record names the declaration, so those resolved by name. **A citation now names  
one line, the declaration's own.** The ranges and lists the older anchors carried  
— `helper.c3:195-205`, `helper.c3:60,86,111,127` — collapsed into the declarations  
they pointed into. Two of them were already stale before this stage:  
`mtk.c3:39` was `module mtk;` before 3TK-69 added two lines to that block, and  
`pool.c3:761` was past the end of a 754-line file. **Resolving from the text is  
what found both; arithmetic on the numbers would have carried them forward.**

### Verification, read off the generated page

**`preview-docs.sh`, and the counts are docgen's own, not predicted.**  
`mtk::inner` **falls from 26 to 13**; `mtk::inner::internal` is 14, which is the  
13 that were below the banner plus `inner_offset` from the folded third section.  
`mtk` 10, `mtk::helper` 11 and still **the only page marked generic**,  
`mtk::queue` 11, `mtk::queue::internal` 1, `mtk::mailbox` 17,  
`mtk::mailbox::internal` 6, `mtk::pool::hooks` 1, `mtk::pool` 16,  
`mtk::pool::internal` 11. **Every one of the eleven carries a description.**

**The negatives still abort in the safe builds** — `unstamped_insert`,  
`unstamped_crossing`, `wrong_type_must`, `insert_linked_outer` — and every other  
negative behaves as specified; that is inside the 107.

**Rule 9.** `run-builds.sh` is the only ported script this stage changed, and  
`matryoshka-3tk/scripts/run-builds.sh` is tuned to match. The `diff` is two  
lines: the `ROOT` line, which is meant to differ, and `run-builds.sh:60`'s  
`insert_linked_item`, which is **3TK-68's finding and still the owner's to port**  
— it names a file the owner has not copied across yet, so changing it there would  
break that repo's copy today. **The three `.yml` files needed no change**, and  
this is the sentence the plan requires: `linux.yml` runs `c3c build mtk`, a target  
name in `project.json` that no module rename touches; `docs.yml` runs `c3c docgen  
--emit-stdlib=no src` over the directory; `sanitizers.yml` names nothing this  
stage moved.

**`src/*.c3` is now 684 lines by `L-1`'s definition**, up from 665. Computed on  
demand and not committed, per Rule 5; `[[LOC]]` is still the token in  
`src/mtk.c3` and in the reference.

### What is flagged and not taken

- **The two `examples/` lines read `inner::internal::` now**, as the plan said
  they would. Whether `010` and `012` should demonstrate layering differently is  
  the owner's, later.
- **The near-miss hook guard is still a candidate stage**, unchanged by this one.
- **Nothing in `matryoshka-3tk`'s `src`/`test`/`negative`/`examples` is copied**,
  and this stage adds all six `src/` files, `test/` and `negative/` to that queue.

---

## 2026-09-09 — INTR 11: an outside review triaged, and 60 marks that are still there

**Numbered 11 by the owner.** The count is worth stating because the file  
disagreed with itself: `3tk-status.md` said *"Seven have run"*, its table listed  
rows through **INTR 8**, and an unnumbered INTR of 2026-09-07 — the one that  
took the state out of `OuterHelper` — is recorded in the status file and in no  
table. The owner ruled this one **INTR 11**, so the numbering is now the owner's  
and not a count of rows. Rule 10: the definition is revised in passing and the  
disagreement is recorded rather than argued.

**The input was `~/Downloads/3tk-analysis.md`** — several AI sittings analysing  
the C3 toolkit, ending in a summary judgement and nineteen numbered pieces of  
advice. **It was read once and is not a source of truth**; what it found is  
triaged here so that nothing depends on that file surviving. The sections on  
mailbox/pool policies were excluded by the owner and are not triaged.

### What it was actually looking at, and why a whole class of its findings is void

**The published archive** — `matryoshka-3tk`, version 0.0.1, sources only. So  
*"zero tests, zero examples, zero build integration in the archive"*, *"the  
script is not present"* and *"no design document or test suite accompanies the  
sources"* are **artifacts of the copy lag, not findings about the project.**  
`test/` runs 145 tests in four builds, `examples/` is 52 files wrapped by  
`t_examples.c3`, `design/` is eight documents, and `run-builds.sh` is 107 checks.  
A reader of the published repo sees none of it, because nothing since 3TK-62 has  
been copied.

**That is worth keeping for its own sake: it is what an outsider currently  
sees.** It is not a defect and no stage fixes it; the copy is the owner's step.

### The finding that changes a stage: the marks are not gone

**`3tk-status.md` said the `[3tk: ...]` marks *"are gone from `src/`"*. Measured  
2026-09-09: 60 remain** — `pool.c3` 37, `mailbox.c3` 10, `helper.c3` 7,  
`queue.c3` 3, `inner.c3` 3.

**The log was precise where the status summary was not.** The entry of  
2026-09-08 removed **103** marks and named them exactly: the citations into  
`3tk-decisions-007.md`, of the shape `// [3tk: D1 to D16, ...]`. The 60  
survivors are a different shape — `[3tk: Part 9.2 rule 3]`, `[3tk: Q-8, Part  
5.2]`, `[3tk: R12, V11, Part 12.2]`. Nothing was reverted and nothing was  
half-done; the status sentence generalised a removal that was specific.

**And the survivors are not one kind of thing.**

- **14 carry a non-`Part` id** — `Q-8` at eight sites, `R12` twice, `V11` twice,
  `A3` twice, `D6` once, `P1` once. `Q-`, `R-` and `V-` are  
  **`3tk-boundaries-001.md`** ids, and that document is **spent, in  
  `matryoshka-3tk/design/backup/`, which is transient and is not a source of  
  truth.** These point at nothing a stage may cite.
- **46 are a bare `Part N.M`, and those are ambiguous by construction.** The
  shared specification and the spent Boundaries document **both number Parts the  
  same way**, and the mark does not say which it means.

**The ambiguity was measured, not assumed.** `[3tk: Q-8, Part 5.2]` sits on the  
`$Typeof` arms of `look`, `must_look` and `take`. Specification `Part 5.2` is  
*"What it is not"* — identity is not a string, not an index — which has nothing  
to do with those arms. Boundaries `5.2` is *"The safe-build identity check — at  
both boundaries"*, which is exactly what they do. **The mark resolves only by  
reading what it sits on.**

**Ruled: classify, do not blanket-remove.** A mark that resolves to the live  
shared specification is a working citation and stays. A mark that resolves to  
Boundaries is dangling and goes. **Each one is resolved from the code it sits on,  
never from the number it carries** — 3TK-66's method, and the same reason: the  
number is the thing that went stale.

**Execution belongs to `3TK-70`**, which has all four files open for the module  
split. Comment noise and declaration noise are one problem with two symptoms,  
and the stage that opens the files pays for both.

### Two more findings that reach into 3TK-70

- **The *not a container library* sentence.** The review is right that the claim
  sits beside a shipped public `InnerQueue`. `3tk-reference-009.md` fixes the  
  sentence; nothing about the design changes.
- **`InnerStack` gets its documentation for free.** The review called it
  *"consistent but undocumented"*. After the split it is listed **and described  
  as internal** on the `mtk::pool::internal` page — which is what was missing.  
  Only the other half of that advice, *make it public*, contradicts a ruling.

### Advice answered, so it is not re-raised as open

- **Advice 1 — remove the "dead" `if (s.is_empty()) return;` after the `@check`
  in `push_back_slot`. Wrong, and the reason matters.** `mtk::@check` is gated  
  and compiles out in a fast build, so that line is the **fast-build guard**, not  
  dead code. The review assumed the check is always present. `queue.c3:100-101`  
  stays as it is.
- **Advice 4 — make `InnerStack` public.** Reverses 3TK-62, which deliberately
  reversed 3TK-45.
- **Advice 9 and 10 — `try_release`, `wait_quiet`, an epoch or refcount wait.**
  These reopen the owner's ruling of 2026-08-28: *release while a call is in  
  flight is not prevented, it is written down and it is checked, and it is not  
  waited for.*
- **4.5 on `Inner.as`** — *"`@require is_mine` but the body does the arithmetic
  unconditionally"* is Rule 1 working exactly as designed.
- **Advice 14 — "once C3 visibility works on methods, delete the banner+grep
  enforcement."** It never will; `@private` and `@local` are both ignored on a  
  method. `3TK-70` gets the outcome the advice wanted by another route: the  
  banner becomes a **module boundary**.

### Flags, not acted on

- **`UNKNOWN_IDENTITY` is both a fault and a defect** and the dual nature is not
  documented in one place (advice 2).
- **The memory-order assumptions are undocumented** beyond the ACQUIRE/RELEASE
  pair on the closed flag (advice 3).
- **`send` returns `CLOSED` where `put` returns `void`** — the *Slot is the
  answer* convention covers both, and the failure modes differ (advice 6).

### One flag found in this sitting, not from the review

**A misspelled hook name is silently not called.** `OuterHelper.create` compiles  
`$if $defined(outer.init):`, so:

- a wrong **signature** is loud — `$defined` still finds the name, the branch
  compiles, and `outer.init(a)` then fails to compile;
- a wrong **return type** is loud — `if (catch f = ...)` on a non-optional does
  not compile, and the same holds for `destroy` under `@catch`;
- a wrong **name** — `Init`, `initialize`, `deinit` — answers false, the branch
  vanishes, and **nothing is reported at any stage.**

`alloc::new_try` zeroes, so the result is not garbage but a **plausible zeroed  
outer**: since 3TK-64, `Event`, `Sensor` and both `Holder`s fill their  
`Allocator` field in an `init` hook, and a missed hook leaves that field null to  
fail far from its cause. No test can catch it — every example with a hook  
exercises it, which proves the mechanism and never proves a given user spelled  
the name right.

**A candidate later stage:** a compile-time near-miss guard that `$error`s when  
an outer defines `Init`, `initialize`, `Deinit`, `deinit`, `Destroy` or  
`dispose` and defines neither `init` nor `destroy`. Compile-time, no runtime  
cost, no ceremony added, and the same shape as `MS-9`'s field matching, whose  
failure message already names the fix. **`3TK-70` only documents the hazard**,  
in `mtk::helper`'s new hooks paragraph.

**Port note:** this is a finding about 3tk's structural hook detection and it  
stays in 3tk's folder. Whether dtk or otk care is theirs to rule.

### What this INTR changed

**No code.** Two corrections and a set of flags in `3tk-status.md`, and the  
rulings that `3tk-staging-plan-031.md` then cites. `run-builds.sh` was not re-run  
and did not need to be: nothing under `3tk/` was touched.

---

## 2026-09-08 — the `[3tk: ...]` marks removed, no stage

**No charter, no plan entry — an owner instruction, ruled and done directly.**  
All 103 `// [3tk: D1 to D16, ...]`-shaped marks, the citations into  
`3tk-decisions-007.md`, are gone from `src/*.c3` in `matryoshka-tk`'s copy.

**Nothing checked their content.** `run-builds.sh`'s `block_head`,  
`doc_blocks.py`'s `source_block` and `move-module-docs.sh` all stepped over any  
`//` line sitting between a `<* *>` block and its declaration, generically —  
not by parsing what a mark said — so removing the marks changed no check  
outcome, only the comments in those three files that described them (ported to  
`matryoshka-3tk/scripts/run-builds.sh`'s copy too; `doc_blocks.py` and  
`move-module-docs.sh` have none there and were not touched). `ref/3tk-doc-loop-004.md`  
and `3tk-status.md` had their own stale descriptions of the marks corrected to  
match.

**Verified after:** `check-doc-loop.sh` 410 of 410, 0 differing, 0 banned words;  
`run-builds.sh` 107 checks, 0 failures, four builds green — both identical to  
the figures before the removal.

**`matryoshka-3tk/src/*.c3` still carries the marks**, waiting on the owner's  
own copy across, per the standing rule that 3tk sources are edited in  
`matryoshka-tk` only.

---

## 2026-09-08 — `3TK-69`: the source LOC, computed and injected

**Model: Sonnet 5**, as `3tk-staging-plan-030.md` pinned it. Applied `L-1` …  
`L-12` from the sitting recorded below; decided nothing new.

**Step 1, the counter.** `matryoshka-3tk/scripts/c3_loc.py` (the scanner) and  
`count_src_loc.sh` (the wrapper), written fresh per `L-1` — a `startswith` test  
is wrong for C3, which has `/* */` and `<* *>` as state carried across lines, not  
a per-line property. The scanner blanks every comment, doc-block and string-  
literal span across the whole file first, then counts per line on what remains,  
so a block comment opened on one line and closed lines later, and a line that is  
code with a trailing `//` comment, are both handled correctly — both were in the  
test fixture built to check it. **`src/*.c3` is 665 lines by this definition,  
against 2,073 raw** (`wc -l`); the difference is comments, doc blocks and the  
five `import` lines the definition excludes. Run twice on an unchanged tree,  
same number both times.

**Step 2, the token.** `src/mtk.c3`'s module doc block gained one sentence,  
*"We present you `[[LOC]]` lines of source."*, and the identical sentence was  
added to `3tk-reference-008.md` at the matching point. **One thing was found and  
removed, not part of this charter:** the tree already carried a  
`const String LOC = "[[LOC]]";` declaration with its own doc block, undocumented  
in the reference — exactly the C3-constant shape `L-11` ruled against ("nothing  
reads such a constant today"), and `check-doc-loop.sh` caught it as one missing  
descriptor the moment the new sentence was checked. Removed; `check-doc-loop.sh`  
is clean at 410 of 410 with the removal, 411 of 410 (1 missing) without it.

**Step 3, the injector.** `matryoshka-3tk/scripts/inject_src_loc.sh`, per `L-3`,  
`L-5`, `L-6`, `L-7` and `L-10`: runs the counter, replaces every `[[LOC]]` under  
`src/`, dry run by default, `--write` to touch files, `--strict` turns a missing  
token into exit 1 (CI passes both; a person passes neither unless they mean it).  
Verified: dry run on a scratch copy carrying one `[[LOC]]` reports one occurrence  
and leaves the tree unchanged; `--write` on that same copy replaces it with 665  
and nothing else; a scratch tree with no token exits 0 under default and exits 1  
under `--strict`.

**Step 4, `docs.yml`.** One step, "Inject source LOC", added before `c3c docgen`  
in `matryoshka-3tk/.github/workflows/docs.yml`, running  
`scripts/inject_src_loc.sh --write --strict` against the runner's own checkout  
(`L-8` — never a copied tree, or every "Defined in" link 404s). The "Defined in"  
patch step is untouched. **`linux.yml` and `sanitizers.yml` were read, not just  
grepped, and neither needs a change** — both build and test straight from  
`src/`, and `[[LOC]]` sitting inside a `<* *>` doc-block sentence is prose, not  
code, so it compiles either substituted or not.

**Step 5, the rules file.** `3tk-rules-001.md` Rule 5's sentence — *generated  
content never edits a checked-in source* — is replaced with `L-9`'s sharpened  
wording: *generated content is never committed, and is injected downstream of  
the checkout.* The three harms it names are restated to show all three still  
hold under the sharpened rule. Nothing else in the file moved.

**Verification, in full.**

- `run-builds.sh`: **107 checks, 0 failures, four builds green.** Unchanged from
  before this stage — nothing here touches a declaration.
- `check-doc-loop.sh`: **410 of 410, 0 differing, 0 banned words** (409 was the
  count before the sentence was added to both sides; the removal above is why it  
  is 410, not 411, that is clean).
- The two new scripts have no `matryoshka-tk` copy, per `L-2` — the first 3tk
  script pair that is not ported.
- The four ported scripts' `matryoshka-3tk` diff still shows only the `ROOT`
  line as this stage's own difference. **One other line differs and is not  
  this stage's:** `run-builds.sh`'s `RUNTIME_NEGATIVES` still says  
  `insert_linked_item` in `matryoshka-3tk`, while `matryoshka-tk`'s copy already  
  reads `insert_linked_outer` — an uncommitted rename from before this stage  
  started, waiting on the owner's own port. Not touched here.

---

## 2026-09-08 — the sitting that ruled the source LOC, and plan 030

**No stage, no code, and no `run-builds.sh` run.** A second owner sitting on the  
same day as `3TK-67`, `3TK-65`, `3TK-66` and `3TK-68`, called after `3TK-68`  
closed and before `3TK-69` was started. It answered every question 029's  
`3TK-69` charter had left open, and the answers are `L-1` … `L-12` in
[3tk-staging-plan-030.md](3tk-staging-plan-030.md). **029 is spent and in
`backup/`.**

**Why a new plan rather than an edit.** 029's charter for `3TK-69` was a set of  
cautions and an unmeasured probe; what came out of the sitting is a specified  
stage. A plan version is not rewritten in place, and the owner ruled explicitly  
that all of it lands in the files rather than in a session's memory, **because  
the stage runs after a clear and possibly on another model.**

**The route was found by elimination, and each step was the owner's.** The  
session first recommended patching the generated `docs.html`, on the ground that  
`docs.yml` already patches it once. The owner preferred injecting into  
`src/mtk.c3`, and the argument that settled it is durability: **the HTML patch is  
coupled to docgen's output shape — its own comment says so — while a placeholder  
is a string 3tk owns.** Along the way three shapes were dropped: a C3 constant in  
`src/` (a permanent doc-loop `DIFFERS`, and it divides the landing page `3TK-67`  
had just trimmed to four declarations), a generated module in its own folder  
(the owner: the file need not be C3 at all, so no module, no `project.json`  
change, no build participation), and `$include` (the manual's trust level 2,  
paid by four builds, four matrix legs, the sanitizers, docgen, **and every  
downstream user of 3tk**).

**One measurement decided more than any argument.** `docs.yml` runs  
`c3c docgen --emit-stdlib=no src` — **`src` and nothing else** — and  
`3tk/project.json` says `"sources": [ "src/**" ]`. Two independent source lists,  
so the folder a file sits in is already the visibility control, for free. And  
the same file's existing patch builds source links as  
`'…/blob/main/' + filePath`, which is why the injection must happen **in the  
runner's own checkout and not into a copied tree**: docgen records the path it  
was given, and `build/src/` would 404 every "Defined in" link on the site.

**Two small things the session got wrong and the owner corrected.** It proposed  
`c3c docgen … src gen`, having assumed the generated module was meant to be  
published — it is meant to be absent. And it accepted a template file holding the  
sentence to match; the owner's requirement was that `mtk.c3` be editable without  
touching the script, and a file holding the sentence is a **second place to keep  
byte-identical**, which defeats exactly that. **The token alone is the contract**,  
and if a file is ever wanted it maps token → producer.

**`[[LOC]]` was chosen against three tests:** no meaning in C3, not an `@` (which  
would read as a contract directive and invite a false check), and obviously a  
slot to a human. `[[NAME]]` is reserved for any later token.

**Rule 5 is sharpened rather than broken.** *Generated content never edits a  
checked-in source* becomes *generated content is never **committed**, and is  
injected downstream of the checkout* — and the three harms the rule names are all  
still avoided. **`3TK-69` carries the new wording into `3tk-rules-001.md`.**

**One question is left open and it is the owner's** — `L-11`, whether a program  
must read the count as a C3 constant. Nothing reads such a constant today, so  
`3TK-69` proceeds on *no*. **If it is ruled in, `$include` and its trust flag come  
back and the stage is Opus 5 rather than Sonnet 5.**

**`3tk-status.md` was brought up to date in the same sitting**: `3TK-68` closed —  
its row still said *Next* — the four stages of 2026-09-08 added to the table of  
those that have run, the measured numbers moved off `3TK-67`'s reading to  
`3TK-68`'s 107 checks and 145 tests and `3TK-66`'s 409 of 409, and *How to start  
after a clear* rewritten for `3TK-69`.

---

## 2026-09-08 — 3TK-68: the names and the scripts

**Ran on Sonnet 5, as the charter asked.** Small, and every step was applying a  
settled rule with a check that said when it was wrong.

**`negative/insert_linked_item.c3` is renamed to `negative/insert_linked_outer.c3`.**  
It was the one filename still carrying a retired word — 3TK-60's scan was over  
file *contents*, so a filename was never in its scope. `test/` and the rest of  
`negative/` stayed clean on a fresh check. `run-builds.sh:60`'s  
`RUNTIME_NEGATIVES` entry moved with it in this repo's copy.

**The `matryoshka-3tk/scripts/` audit: all four ported scripts diffed clean.**  
`preview-docs.sh`, `run-builds-light.sh` and `run-sanitizers.sh` differ from this  
repo's copies only in the `ROOT` line, as the rule expects. `run-builds.sh` had a  
second difference — matryoshka-3tk's copy still reads `insert_linked_item` at  
line 60 — which is exactly the rename this stage owns; it is the owner's to port  
along with the rest of the file, per [[edit-sources-in-tk-only]].

**The `.yml` review, `docs.yml` included: none needed.** `linux.yml` and  
`sanitizers.yml` invoke `c3c test` directly, not `run-builds.sh`, and `docs.yml`  
only patches docgen's generated HTML — none of the three names  
`insert_linked_item` or `RUNTIME_NEGATIVES`.

**`run-builds.sh` ran full after the rename: 107 passed, 0 failed, all four  
builds green** — the renamed negative still aborts in the safe builds and exits  
0 in the fast ones, as `insert_linked_item.c3` did before it.

---

## 2026-09-08 — 3TK-66: the books and the examples

**Ran on Opus 5, which is what the charter asked for.** The bulk stage, and the  
last of the rethinking: 52 example files moved onto the helper, four books  
rewritten to lead with it, 326 `file:line` citations recomputed from the built  
tree, and the closing act that retires `3tk-boundaries-001.md` and  
`3tk-terms-001.md`. `run-builds.sh` stayed **107 green in four builds, 145  
tests** each — this stage changed no `src/` declaration, and that is the point:  
the surface was already built, and what was missing was every document and every  
example still teaching the layer beneath it.

### The examples were the measurement, and they inverted it

`MS-1` measured the user's vocabulary on 2026-09-06, before the helper had  
users: the five crossing methods called **51 times** across `examples/`, the  
free `inner::` forms twice. That was the evidence for keeping the methods public,  
and it stands. But it was also the evidence that **52 files were teaching the  
lower layer**, because there was nothing else to teach yet.

**58 crossing call sites moved to the helper**, mechanically and then checked by  
hand: `s.must(T)` → `T.must_look(&s)`, `s.to(T)` → `look`, `s.move(T)` → `take`,  
`inner.as(T)` → `must_look`. The count today is **five method sites and one free  
site**, all six inside the two files whose subject is the layering itself.

**The mechanical pass got three sites wrong and the compiler caught all three.**  
`free_outer(Allocator a, Slot* s)` takes a `Slot*` already, so the `&` the script  
added made the argument a `Slot**` and `look`'s `$default` arm fired —  
*"look takes a Slot* or an Inner*"*, naming the example's own line through two  
`Note: Inlined from here` frames. **That is the `$switch`-on-`$Typeof` dispatch  
doing exactly what it was built for**, and it is the first time the arm has  
fired outside a negative program.

### Two examples keep both layers, and the rule now says so

`012-type_crossing.c3` and `013-recovering_the_type.c3` show the helper member  
**beside** the form it forwards to, and assert they land on the same pointer.  
`012` grew a third spelling and its assertion went `code == 2` → `code == 3`.

**A new MUST went into `3tk-example-rules-004.md`:** every example leads with the  
helper, one alias per outer type, and **only those two files are exempt**. A  
third file doing this is a defect. The exemption does not reach `test/`, which  
probes the primitives deliberately and keeps callers on all five methods — that  
is why the examples could drop them without leaving anything unexercised.

### The reference: the helper moved to the front of Part 3

The API sections were ordered identity → crossing → Slot → link → queue → stack  
→ guards → **helper**, which put the thing a user binds after seven things they  
mostly do not touch. **The helper section is now first**, and *identity* and  
*crossing* open with a *Beneath the helper* paragraph saying when to read past it:  
a dispatch loop holding an `Inner*` with no helper bound for the type it is  
testing.

**`mtk::managed` was still the whole of *Usual flow*.** The module was deleted by  
3TK-64, and Part 3's worked example still called `managed::create(Msg, …)` and  
`s.must(Msg)`. It is now four steps — define, bind, transport, recover — and  
every `managed::` in the book is gone, Parts 4, 5 and 6 included.

**Two sweep artifacts were found and fixed, both from the two-term rename.**  
*"`catch f = ...` names the fault and **inners** it"* in the reference and *"the  
example does not own the **inner** it was handed"* in the example rules — a  
mechanical *handle* → *inner* that hit two English words. `h` as a variable name  
survived in six code blocks and is now `inner`.

### Boundaries `Part 6` is written in as its own section

*What is deliberately absent* now sits in the reference before *Master — not part  
of the API*: what is not on the helper, what left the surface entirely, the two  
spellings that survive and which one to reach for, and the four constructs that  
were each dropped because a smaller thing already did the job.

**One sentence of Part 6 needed correcting on the way in.** It named the  
surviving free spelling `mtk::to_inner(outer)`; `3TK-pre-65` reversed the module  
merge, so it is `inner::to_inner(outer)`.

### The API table took its largest revision, and it is still `004`

Revised in place, because this file's own rule says *revised whenever `3tk/src`  
changes, in the same stage that changes it* — and 3TK-62 through 3TK-65 had all  
changed the source without it. It was four versions behind: `mtk::managed` and  
`stack.c3` had sections, `VERSION` read `"0.2.0"`, the helper section documented  
free crossings that had moved to `inner.c3`, and `struct Mailbox` was documented  
as having reachable fields.

**The seven internal methods `003` listed as *reachable by convention* are now  
unreachable by construction.** `Mailbox` and `Pool` are `typedef … = void` over  
`@private` `_Mbox` and `_Pool`. That is the entry that changed most, because the  
old one documented a gap that no longer exists.

### The `007` repair, and the deletion that proves it finished

**326 citations across `007` and the api table were recomputed**, and none from  
the number it carried — those numbers *were* the corruption. 3TK-63's three-pass  
renumbering had its third pass match on old line numbers, many-to-one and not  
reversible. **Each citation was resolved from its own entry's text**: where the  
entry names a declaration, the citation is that declaration's line (82 in `007`);  
where it rules something about a file as a whole, it is that file's `module` line  
(124). **A citation is a pointer into a file, and only sometimes at a line**, and  
the header now says that rather than apologising for it.

**Four entries were false, not merely stale**, and Boundaries `Appendix B` was  
the map for finding them — which is what the appendix existed for:

- **`RT-3`** recorded the helper's module as `mtk`, *"not `mtk::helper`"*.
  `3TK-pre-65` reversed that merge on 2026-09-07.
- **`PL-6`** recorded the crossing as `mtk::to_inner`, *"because `mtk::inner` is
  not a module name any more"*. **It is one again.**
- **`RT-5`/`RT-13`** — `xtn` and the allocator field. Both stand as superseded.
- **`RT-7`/`RT-8`** named the field `otrid`; it was built as `outer_tid`.

**Appendix B was deleted**, which is what its own first line asked for, and that  
deletion is the proof the repair finished. **The `Ruled by 3TK-61, decided and  
not yet built` section was closed with it** — every entry had been folded down by  
3TK-62 through 3TK-65, and its own discharge rule said the section goes when it  
empties.

### The closing act, and one thing it forced

`3tk-boundaries-001.md` and `3tk-terms-001.md` moved to  
`matryoshka-3tk/design/backup/` with a plain `mv`.

**`backup/` is transient, so nothing may cite it as a source of truth** — and  
three books cited `3tk-terms-001.md` by name for the two-term ruling. Each now  
carries the ruling and its date instead of a pointer. **`007` is the exception  
and says so**: it cites Boundaries by part number at a dozen places, and those  
are now framed in its header as **historical markers** — which sitting ruled the  
entry — with `007` and `../3tk/src` as what stands where they would differ.

### The api table became `005`, and the version has a hole in it

**The stage revised `3tk-api-004.md` in place**, on the strength of the file's  
own *It is alive* rule — *revised whenever `3tk/src` changes, in the same stage  
that changes it* — and because `029` listed no `005` among the versions written.  
It then said so, and flagged that the drift was large enough for a version to be  
defensible. **The owner ruled it a version.** `3tk-api-005.md` is the file, and  
the three inbound pointers moved with it.

**`004` is not in `backup/`, and could not be put there honestly.** The  
in-place revision had already overwritten it, and git is not run in this work, so  
the pre-3TK-66 text no longer existed by the time the ruling came. A copy in  
`backup/` would be byte-identical to `005` and would misdescribe itself as the  
superseded version. **Nothing is lost** — `003` is in `matryoshka-tk`'s  
`backup/`, and what `004` said that `005` does not is the list in `005`'s own  
provenance: `mtk::managed` and `stack.c3` as sections, `VERSION` as `"0.2.0"`,  
the free crossings under a `mtk::helper` heading, and `struct Mailbox` described  
as having reachable fields.

**The lesson is the ordering, not the loss.** A stage that revises a versioned  
document in place has spent the option of versioning it, and it spends it before  
the owner has seen the size of the change. **A stage that finds itself making a  
revision this large writes the new version first and asks after**, which costs  
one `mv` and leaves the choice open. That is worth a rule if it happens twice.  
---

## 2026-09-08 — 3TK-65: the safe-build checks, at both boundaries

**Ran on Opus 5, which is what the charter asked for.** Small in lines and high  
in judgment per line, exactly as `3tk-staging-plan-029.md` predicted: it writes  
into `<* *>` blocks that carry contracts, it designs two negative programs, and  
it makes one deliberate refusal. `run-builds.sh` went **95 → 107**, four builds,  
**143 → 145 tests** each. `HR-5` is discharged and `Q-8` is answered.

### The stamp was already idempotent, so what this stage owed it was its reason

`3TK-64` wrote `inner.link = any_make(inner.link.ptr, ...)` and `Part 5.1`'s  
first requirement — *the stamp may be written any number of times, and its  
argument is a typed `Outer*`* — was already true when this stage opened.  
`OuterHelper.stamp(self, Outer* outer)` is the typed door and `inner::stamp` is  
what it forwards to. **Nothing was rewritten.**

What was missing is the thing `Part 5.1` asks for in the same breath: *"This  
line must be written into the file with its reason."* The natural maintenance  
edit is `any_make(null, …)` — the old `init` body verbatim — which compiles and  
**silently unlinks a linked outer**. The correct line differs from the  
destructive one by one sub-expression, and now a `//` block above it says so and  
says *do not simplify it*. **A `//` block and not the doc block, because Rule 2  
allows no prose inside an internal `<* *>`.**

### One shared guard, not eight open-coded conditions

```c3
macro check_stamped(Inner* inner, $msg)
{
    mtk::@check(inner == null || (void*)inner.outer_tid() != null, $msg);
}
```

It lives in part 2 of `inner.c3`, below the internal banner, with the marker and  
no directives — Rules 2 and 3, and `run-builds.sh` confirms the partition.

**One shape in one place, because the tolerance is the subtle half.** Null is  
**not** the violation. An empty Slot and a null `Inner*` are answers a checking  
crossing is allowed to give, and `look` on an empty Slot is the ordinary way to  
ask whether anything arrived; a guard that refused null would turn that into an  
abort. Only an inner that **exists** and carries no identity is a defect. Eight  
open-coded conditions are eight chances to get that wrong, so the check in  
`run-builds.sh` greps for `check_stamped` and not for `@check`.

**A measured C3 fact, on c3c 0.8.3.** A `typeid` does not compare against  
`null` — the compiler answers *"You cannot cast 'void\*' to 'typeid'"* — so the  
**pointer side** is what is cast: `(void*)inner.outer_tid() != null`. Probed in  
a scratch file before it went into `src/`, per the standing constraint. A zeroed  
`Inner` gives null and a stamped one does not.

### The two boundaries, and why neither is redundant

- **The crossing** — `look`, `must_look`, `take`, `must_take` in `helper.c3`.
  This is the late boundary, and without it the missing identity becomes a crash  
  with no message at a `switch` that looks correct.
- **The insertion** — `InnerQueue.@guard_insert` and `InnerStack.@guard_insert`.
  This is the early one, and earlier is where the message has a home: at an  
  insertion the call that omitted the stamp is still on the stack, and by the  
  next crossing it is long gone.

An outer whose Slot is filled by hand reaches **no** insertion, which is why the  
crossing keeps its own check; an outer pushed straight onto a queue reaches **no**  
crossing. **Neither program can reach the other's site**, and that is the whole  
argument for two.

**The abort names the user's line**, verified rather than assumed: the backtrace  
ends `main (negative/unstamped_crossing.c3:26)`, with `look`, `check_stamped`,  
`@check` and `always_assert` above it.

**Both are gated by `mtk::@check`, so a fast build carries nothing** — the  
condition is not evaluated and `outer_tid` is never called. Measured, not  
claimed: both negatives run to the end and exit 0 in `--safe=no -O0` and  
`--safe=no -O3`.

### FOUR CROSSINGS, SIX CALL SITES — and the charter's figure was the one that moved

`run-builds.sh`'s first draft asserted four `check_stamped` calls in `helper.c3`  
and **went red at six**. `look` and `must_look` each dispatch on `$Typeof` into  
a `Slot*` arm and an `Inner*` arm, and **each arm is a site that can be dropped  
on its own**. Plan 029 says four and is counting crossings; the check counts  
sites. **Rule 10 — the measurement wins and the stage says so in the log** — so  
the number in the script is six, with the reason written beside it, and no stage  
"corrects" it back.

### The `[&in]` annotation: asked, and deliberately refused

`3TK-67` left this to `3TK-65` on purpose, and the answer is **no**.

`@param [&in]` is a null check, and **`to_inner` accepts null on purpose** —  
*null in, null out* is a sentence its module block has carried since the  
crossings were written. Adding the annotation would smuggle a new runtime abort  
in under a formatting rule.

The refusal is not left as prose. `test/t_identity.c3` gained  
`to_inner_takes_null_and_answers_null` and  
`the_identity_check_tolerates_null` — the two tests that go red if a later stage  
adds `[&in]`, or tightens `check_stamped` to reject null. **That is the negative  
program the status file asked for, standing behind a refusal instead of behind  
an addition.**

### The two negative programs

- **`unstamped_insert`** — a stack `Msg`, never stamped, straight into
  `InnerQueue.push_back`. Safe: aborts in `@guard_insert`. Fast: exits 0 with an  
  unstamped outer on the queue.
- **`unstamped_crossing`** — the Slot filled by hand, so no guard runs, then
  `MSG.look(&s)`. Safe: aborts in `OuterHelper.look`. Fast: `look` answers null,  
  the identity never having been read.

Both are **runtime** negatives, both registered, both green in all four modes.

### The new checks were broken in both directions before they were trusted

Rule 8, and it is not a formality — three deliberate breaks on copies, each  
restored:

1. dropped one `$Typeof` arm's check → *"src/helper.c3 has 5 of the 6"*.
2. dropped `queue.c3`'s guard line → *"src/queue.c3 has 0 of the 1"*.
3. swapped `mtk::@check` for `always_assert` in `check_stamped` →
   *"check_stamped no longer goes through mtk::@check — the check is in every  
   build"*.

### The figures

**`run-builds.sh`: 107 checks, 0 failures, four builds, 145 tests each.**  
95 → 107 is eight negative-program passes (two programs × four modes) and four  
new script checks. 143 → 145 is the two tolerance tests.

**The doc loop is clean: 5 labelled blocks, 0 differing, 409 of 409 sentences,  
0 banned words, `move-module-docs.sh roundtrip` byte-identical.** 408 → 409 is  
one sentence, added to `OuterHelper.stamp`'s block and mirrored in the  
reference: *"Forgetting it is caught in a safe build, at the next crossing or at  
the next insertion, whichever comes first."* **The source says what; the  
reference says why**, and the why — the two boundaries, the null tolerance, the  
gating, the two programs — went into `3tk-reference-008.md` beside it.

### The port, and CI

`run-builds.sh` is the only script that changed. Copied to  
`matryoshka-3tk/scripts/`, the `ROOT` line re-applied, and **the `diff` is that  
one line and nothing else** — verified for all four ported scripts.

**The three `.yml` files needed no change, and all three were read to say so.**  
`linux.yml` and `sanitizers.yml` run `c3c build`/`c3c test` on the matrix and  
name no symbol, no module and no file; the two new tests are picked up by  
`c3c test` on their own. `docs.yml` runs `c3c docgen` on `src` as a directory  
and its only assertion is on a string inside c3c's own generated HTML. **The  
negatives stay hand-run, which is the standing CI-is-the-matrix gap.**

**`src/`, `test/` and `negative/` are still waiting on the owner to copy across**  
— 3TK-62, 3TK-63, 3TK-64, the INTR, 3TK-pre-65, 3TK-67 and now 3TK-65.  
`3tk-reference-008.md` and `scripts/run-builds.sh` are already in  
`matryoshka-3tk`, edited in place.

## 2026-09-08 — 3TK-67: the landing page, the marker, and 3tk's own rules file

**Ran on Opus 5, which is what the charter asked for — Rule 7's middle case, a  
stage that changes a rule and applies it.** Two steps, no semantics, and the  
proof is that every per-build figure is identical: four builds, 143 tests each,  
eight runtime negatives, seven tier 1, two compile-time. `run-builds.sh` went  
**89 → 95**, and every one of the six new passes is a check this stage wrote.

### The two probes, first, and both came back clean

**Probe 1 — what an `inner::` prefix costs at user sites (`PL-6` / `Q-1`).**  
Measured, not predicted, before a line moved. The free crossings and `stamp`  
appear **twice in all of `examples/`** — `mtk::from_inner` in  
`012-type_crossing.c3` and `mtk::is_mine` in `010-no_raw_allocator_call.c3` —  
and those are the two the partition check already allow-lists on purpose. Every  
other `mtk::` in `examples/` is a fault, `@check`, `CHECKED`, or a submodule  
name, and **all of those stay in `mtk`**. So the landing page costs the user  
surface exactly two lines, both deliberate. `test/` carries 161 and `negative/`  
28, and both are white-box by design.

**The stutter is real and it is confined.** `inner::to_inner` reads badly. It  
was taken anyway, because the alternative is renaming the free macros, which is  
a surface change and not this stage's charter — and because the stutter lands on  
one example line. **`PL-6` / `Q-1` is answered and closed: the prefix is  
`inner::`, and the spelling of the macros is not reopened here.**

**Probe 2 — does `inner_offset` stay hidden?** Built on a scratch copy first.  
With part 1 as `module mtk::inner;` and part 3 as `module mtk::inner @private;`,  
the library builds — so part 2's macros still resolve it — and a program in  
another module calling `inner::inner_offset(Msg)` is refused: *"The macro  
`inner::inner_offset` is `@private` and not visible from other modules."*  
Hiding holds, and it holds harder than before: `mtk::pool` used to be a  
submodule of the module that declared it and is now outside it altogether.

### Step 1 — the landing page

`inner.c3` declares `module mtk::inner;`, its third section  
`module mtk::inner @private;`. `mtk.c3`'s block was rewritten to orient: it names  
the five submodules, states what `mtk` itself holds, and hands each subject to  
the page of the module that holds it. The paragraphs on the inner, the Slot, the  
link and the five crossings moved whole into a new `mtk::inner` block — **the  
text is `mtk`'s own, unchanged**, because it was always this module's subject and  
never the root's. The queue's paragraph was dropped rather than moved: `mtk::queue`  
and `InnerQueue` already carried it, and it was said twice.

**Measured off the generated page, not predicted — and the arithmetic closes  
exactly.** `mtk` was **36** docgen entries. It is now **10**, and `mtk::inner` is  
**26**. `10 + 26 = 36`: nothing vanished in the split and nothing was  
double-counted.

**A correction to the charter's expectation of "four".** Four is the count of  
**source declarations** in `mtk.c3` — `VERSION`, the `faultdef`, `@check`,  
`CHECKED` — and it is right. Docgen publishes **ten**, because it expands the  
`faultdef` of seven into seven entries. The two numbers measure different things  
and both are correct; the charter conflated them. **Rule 10 of the new rules  
file: the measurement wins, the stage says so, and it does not stop to ask.**

### Step 2 — the banner and the marker, with the checks rewritten first

**The exemplar rule was followed and it was not decoration.** The new check went  
in before the sweep, went red on all four files that had not been swept, and went  
green as each was done.

**The two `3TK-pre-65` checks are replaced, not deleted** — *no declaration  
carries the marker and a describing block at once*, and *a contract-only block is  
every line a `@` line, no prose*. Rule 2 requires exactly the combination they  
forbid. What replaces them is **two-directional and total**: every declaration  
below a file's internal banner opens with `For internal usage.`, and none above  
one does. **A file has at most one such banner, and that is checked too**, and  
each banner's presence is asserted by name per file first — otherwise the  
partition check would find no boundary and pass having proved nothing, which is  
the failure mode the stack banner already had a guard for.

**The check was negative-tested in both directions before it was trusted.** A  
marker removed from `_Pool.bucket_for` produced  
`src/pool.c3:621:below-the-banner-and-unmarked`; a marker added to `GetMode`,  
above the banner, produced `src/pool.c3:108:marked-and-not-below-a-banner`. Both  
red, then restored.

**31 declarations, not 34.** The charter's 34 is a `grep` count of the string  
`For internal usage`, and three of those hits are prose *about* the marker — two  
in `inner.c3`'s header and one in `queue.c3`'s. The declarations are **13 in  
`inner.c3`, 1 in `queue.c3`, 6 in `mailbox.c3`, 11 in `pool.c3`**. Likewise  
**four files carry internal declarations, not five**; `helper.c3` and `mtk.c3`  
have none, and the check now asserts that they have none.

**The grouping moved code.** `queue.c3`'s `@guard_insert` sat in the middle of  
the user surface and went to the foot of the file. `mailbox.c3`'s four `_Mbox`  
methods and `_close` came down to join `_Mbox` itself; `pool.c3`'s `PoolBucket`,  
`@closed_fast`, `bucket_for` and `_close` came down to join `_Pool`, above the  
stack section — which is internal too, and is now inside the region rather than  
beside it. **The stack banner is untouched and still the line the layering grep  
cuts at.**

**What the block keeps and what it loses.** The marker is the first line; after  
it only directives that do work. Every `@require` survived — `git diff` confirms  
not one was removed, which was the whole point. What was dropped is four bare  
`@param` lines that restated the signature and carried a description; none of  
them was a check. **No ref annotation was invented.** `to_inner` accepts null on  
purpose, and adding `[&in]` to it would be a new runtime check smuggled in under  
a formatting rule — that is `3TK-65`'s work, done deliberately or not at all.

**The `//` prose below the block was kept.** Rule 2 governs the `<* *>` block,  
which is what docgen publishes and what the doc loop harvests. `_close`'s  
explanation of the RELEASE/ACQUIRE pairing is an implementation comment, invisible  
to both, and deleting it would have been a loss with nothing bought. Stated here  
because the rule could be read the other way.

### The doc loop, and why the 418 moved

`check-doc-loop.sh` now excludes `For internal usage.` **by exact match on the  
whole line** — never by reasoning about punctuation or about what an internal  
declaration looks like, so a marker that drifts by one character stops being  
excluded and goes red, which is the outcome that says so.

**The count went 418 → 408, and the charter predicted it would not move.** The  
prediction was inconsistent with the charter's own Step 1: rewriting `mtk.c3`'s  
block to orient necessarily moves the descriptor count. The −10 is entirely that  
rewrite — `mtk` 85 → 39, `inner` 37 → 73 — and the compression of a paragraph  
`mtk`'s block had said twice.

**The invariant that actually proves the marker was excluded correctly is  
cleaner, and it holds exactly.** `mailbox.c3` stayed at **85**, `pool.c3` at  
**134**, `queue.c3` at **34** — while gaining 6, 11 and 1 markers. Three files  
gained 18 markers and not one sentence. **That is the proof, and a future stage  
should use it rather than the total**, which any prose edit moves.

`move-module-docs.sh roundtrip` is byte-identical, over five labelled blocks now  
rather than four.

### The closing acts

**`matryoshka-3tk/design/3tk-rules-001.md` is created.** Two parts, kept apart:  
**Part 1, the port rules** (1 to 5, from plan 029) and **Part 2, the stage  
rules** — 6 and 7 from Rule 7 of 029, plus **8, the exemplar before the sweep**,  
**9, a stage tunes the scripts and CI**, and **10, fix the definition and do not  
halt**. Those last three were already binding practice and had no written home;  
this stage gave them one, and used all three.

**Boundaries `Part 4.4a` is migrated and marked superseded, not retired.** A note  
at its head says the rule is withdrawn, names Rules 1 to 3 of the new file as its  
replacement, and states that **what 4.4a measured stands and is carried rather  
than re-derived** — docgen's blindness to visibility, and the accepted gap it  
forces. The Part's body is left unedited beneath it, because  
`3tk-decisions-007.md` cites it and `3TK-66` spends the document.

**The reference was edited with the source, not after it.** `3tk-reference-008.md`  
gained the `mtk::inner` labelled block, took `mtk`'s rewritten one, and the  
paragraph that ruled the old block-less shape now carries the superseding text.

**Scripts and CI.** `run-builds.sh` is across in `matryoshka-3tk/scripts/`, and  
the four ported scripts diff against this repo's copies with the `ROOT` line as  
the only difference. `check-doc-loop.sh` and `move-module-docs.sh` are not ported  
scripts and stay here. **The `.yml` files needed no change, and `docs.yml` was  
read rather than grepped**: it runs `c3c docgen --emit-stdlib=no src` and patches  
`href = filePath;` by file path, so it keys on nothing a module rename touches,  
and no file was added or removed. `linux.yml` is the build-and-test matrix and  
`sanitizers.yml` names no module.

### What this stage did not do

The books are `3TK-66`'s. `3tk-api-004.md` and `3tk-patterns-004.md` still spell  
the free crossings `mtk::`; the reference was updated because the doc loop  
requires it, and nothing else was. **The re-anchoring of `3tk-decisions-007.md`'s  
222 citations is still owed, and still after this stage** — which is now behind  
it.

---

## 2026-09-08 — INTR: the doc block, the landing page, and the order

**Owner-initiated, between `3TK-pre-65` and the next stage. Not a stage, and no  
code changed.** The owner read the state, raised five issues in sequence and  
ruled on each. What came out is plan `029`, six rulings, three new stage numbers,  
and an inverted order. `028` is spent and in `backup/`.

### Why an assert is not a contract

The sitting opened on `3TK-pre-65`'s defect — that stripping a `<* *>` block  
stripped `mtk::must_from_inner`'s `@require` and `negative/wrong_type_must`  
stopped aborting. The owner asked whether `@require` and `@ensure` could simply  
be written as asserts in the body instead, which would dissolve the tension  
between the visibility rule and the contract.

**Checked against the manual and the stdlib rather than answered from memory.**  
The claim is one-sixth true. The manual is explicit — *"In safe mode, pre- and  
post-conditions are checked using runtime asserts"* — so c3c literally lowers a  
contract to the thing proposed to replace it. **Five things do not survive the  
swap:** the compile-time catch, which for a macro with a `$Type` argument is  
exactly the case c3c is best at and exactly what `wrong_type_must` sits on; which  
side of the call is named in the failure, the contract naming the **caller** and  
an assert naming 3tk's own file, which for a library about a border crossing  
points at the wrong side; the **optimizer licence**, since a compiler may assume  
a contract holds and violating one is *unspecified behaviour*, so the swap  
removes an obligation from the caller and not only a check; `@ensure`'s binding  
of `return`, which in a body becomes a local plus an assert before every exit;  
and the `@param` ref annotations, which have no assert form at all.

**The stdlib settles it by weight:** `@require` 1456 uses, `@ensure` 56,  
`assert(` 92 — and `collections/list.c3:77-80` is already the contract-only block  
shape `3TK-pre-65` had arrived at independently.

**So the rule holds and is now written where it cannot be lost.** It was living  
in `3tk-boundaries-001.md` `4.4a`, in a `run-builds.sh` check, and in the status  
file's *must not undo* list. `3tk-boundaries-001.md` is spent by 3TK-66, so the  
prose home was about to disappear and leave only the grep.

### The rules file, and what a rule is

The owner named **`matryoshka-3tk/design/3tk-rules-001.md`** and then widened it  
past sources: **every rule specific to 3tk that is not already in the common tk  
rules.** A port rules document, not a source-file one.

**The gap it fills was real and worth recording.** `3tk-example-rules-004.md` is  
normative but says in its own text that it *"does not bind `3tk/src`, `3tk/test`  
or `3tk/negative`"*. `3tk-reference-008.md` describes the surface.  
`3tk-decisions-007.md` records that a thing was ruled. **Nothing bound the  
writing of `src/`,** which is why the contract rule had no home.

**The owner then ruled the discrimination, and it is the part worth keeping:**  
only rules go in it. The test written down is *a rule binds a future stage and  
can be checked* — if it says how 3tk is written and what goes red when it is not,  
it is a rule; if it says what one stage does, when, or why we chose it, it is a  
decision and goes to the plan, the status or this log. A decision filed as a rule  
binds stages that never agreed to it.

**It is not created yet, deliberately.** Writing it on 2026-09-08 would have put  
a normative document in `matryoshka-3tk/design/` describing a shape that  
`3tk/src` does not have — which the standing rule calls a defect of the stage  
that wrote it. `3TK-67` creates it; until then the rules are in `029` verbatim.

### The doc block reverses, and the marker becomes the signal

`3TK-pre-65` had ruled *the doc block is the visibility marker*: an internal  
declaration gets `//` line comments and no `<* *>` at all. **The owner reversed  
it.** An internal declaration keeps a block, opening with the marker and  
carrying only directives that do work, `@param` without a description.

**Recommended and accepted: the marker is a sentence, verbatim.** Two reasons  
pulled the same way. Docgen publishes the description prose, and a fragment  
without a period reads as a truncation where a sentence reads as a statement.  
And the codebase already has the pattern for machine-checkable prose —  
`run-builds.sh` greps `// Part 2 of 3: public, and not yours` and `pool.c3`'s  
stack banner verbatim — so an exact string is checkable by the same means, and  
the doc loop excludes it by matching one constant rather than reasoning about  
punctuation.

**Recommended and accepted: no exception for a declaration with no directives.**  
The temptation was to leave those on `//`, since they carry nothing. Two shapes  
would mean two checks, and the branch between them is *does this declaration have  
a contract* — precisely the fact that broke `wrong_type_must`. It would also make  
adding a `@require` later a formatting migration. And a declaration with no  
contract is exactly the one whose docs page would otherwise be a naked signature.

**On `@param`: kept only when it carries a ref annotation.** A description-less  
`@param` is legal — the manual marks the description optional and the stdlib does  
it 18 times — but a bare `@param inner` restates the signature and carries  
nothing. What earns the line is `[in]`, `[&in]`, `[out]`, `[own]`, `[drop]`,  
`[init]`, which are static analysis and a null check. Same test as everything  
else here: a directive earns its line by doing something a checker acts on.

### The banner, and why it does not replace the marker

The owner proposed grouping every internal declaration under a common header  
instead of repeating a marker 34 times.

**Advice given: do the grouping, and keep the marker anyway** — they solve  
different problems and only one crosses to the docs site. `c3c docgen` ignores  
visibility and groups by module alone, and it publishes no file structure and no  
`//` comment; a reader on the generated page sees a flat list with no sections  
in it. **Group the file perfectly and that reader still gets nothing.**

**But the grouping is the stronger half and was accepted for its own reason.** A  
per-declaration marker fails by **omission** and nothing looks wrong; a  
declaration cannot fail to be somewhere. So position becomes the truth and the  
marker its consequence, and the check becomes total in both directions — every  
declaration below the banner opens with the marker, none above one does.  
**Omission stops being possible rather than merely visible.**

**Priced honestly at the time:** only `inner.c3` is partitioned today, and the  
marked declarations are spread across five files, `pool.c3` ending with two  
banners since it already has the stack one.

### The landing page, and the measurement that made it small

The owner's complaint was the web view: `mtk` at 36 declarations is the longest  
page on the site and it should be the shortest. The proposal — `mtk` a landing  
page, `inner.c3` to its own module — and a question of whether the internal  
macros, the `faultdef` and `VERSION` should move out to avoid cluttering it.

**Measured before answering, and the measurement changed the answer.**  
`src/mtk.c3` is **132 lines holding four declarations** — `VERSION`, the  
`faultdef` of seven, `@check`, `CHECKED`. The other **32 of the 36 come from  
`inner.c3`**, which declares `module mtk;` at line 31. **So moving `inner.c3` out  
produces the landing page by itself and no new file is needed.**

**And nothing in `mtk.c3` is internal.** `@check` and `CHECKED` were checked  
rather than assumed: `examples/060-guarding_an_expensive_check.c3` teaches them  
at four call sites and its whole subject is *guard an expensive check with  
`CHECKED`*. `VERSION` and the faults are the vocabulary every submodule and every  
user shares — the standing fact is written `return mtk::CLOSED~;`. **Four public  
declarations, one a version and one a fault set, is what a root module is for;  
splitting it would have been the mess.**

### The LOC number, deferred, and the rule it produced

The owner intends to compute a source line count in CI and inject it into  
`mtk.c3` before doc generation, and ruled it a separate stage.

**Advised against doing it in the source, and the general rule was accepted:  
generated content never edits a checked-in file.** Three specific breakages: the  
doc loop would carry a number wrong the moment any line of `src/` changed,  
trading a clean 418-of-418 for a permanent `DIFFERS` — and a check that is always  
red stops being read; the two repos would diverge on a line that is not `ROOT`,  
since CI runs in `matryoshka-3tk`; and the tree would come back dirty after every  
build, which is the noise that hides a real change.

**The owner then noted C3 has `$include`/`$exec`, and the claim checked out.**  
`$include` splices a file's text, top level only, no `module` statement inside,  
needs `--trust=include`; `$exec` splices a program's stdout, needs  
`--trust=full`, and runs from `/scripts` for projects; `$embed` is what the  
manual points at for pure data. **The mechanism is real — and `$exec` in shipped  
`src/` is probably disqualified by trust alone, since every downstream user's  
build would need `--trust=full`.** Two further cautions recorded: whether docgen  
expands them at all is unmeasured and decisive, and the doc loop reads only  
`src/*.c3`, so a block in an included file leaves the loop entirely.

**`matryoshka-3tk/.github/workflows/docs.yml` already exists and runs  
`c3c docgen`** — which is the natural home, downstream of the source.

### The order inverted, and a saved question resolved itself

The owner produced a note saved from a previous sitting, listing three open  
pieces about a then-hypothetical `3TK-67`: which stage it was, where  
`3tk-boundaries-001.md` is spent, and that the landing page was *raised, not  
ruled*.

**The third was answered by this sitting.** The first two moved with it.

**The finding that matters: the landing page is not a docs change.** Moving  
`inner.c3` to `mtk::inner` is a **module-layout** change, the same family as  
3TK-63 and `3TK-pre-65`, and it re-spells the free crossings and `mtk::stamp` at  
user sites. **It cannot follow 3TK-66**, which rewrites the books and all 52  
examples — the layout would move under work just delivered. The banner-and-marker  
pass has the same property by another route: it changes `src/` doc blocks, which  
changes what the reference carries, which is 3TK-66's subject.

**So `3TK-65` moves behind both, for the reason 028 itself gave for deferring it  
behind `3TK-pre-65` — so each site is written once and never moved.** 3TK-65's  
sites are exactly what `3TK-67` relocates, and 3TK-65 would touch two  
`run-builds.sh` checks that `3TK-67` rewrites. Its **content** is unaffected;  
this is an ordering, not a redesign. The honest cost, stated at the time: 3TK-65  
was ready to run cold today and `HR-5` stays undischarged longer.

**And the inversion is what lets 3TK-66 keep its closing act.** The saved note  
had moved the retirement of `3tk-boundaries-001.md` off 3TK-66 because a later  
stage would need `Parts 4.2`/`4.2a` live to re-rule against. With `3TK-67`  
running **before** 3TK-66 those parts are live when it needs them. One correction  
stands: **`Part 4.4a` is migrated into `3tk-rules-001.md`, not retired with the  
rest** — retiring it would drop a live rule into an archive.

**The note's other worry resolved on evidence.** It suspected `test/` and  
`negative/` filenames still carried *item*. Checked: **exactly one does —  
`negative/insert_linked_item.c3`** — and 3TK-60's scan could never have seen it,  
being a `grep` over file **contents**. It is referenced at `run-builds.sh:60` in  
`RUNTIME_NEGATIVES`, so the rename and the script audit touch the same line and  
are one stage, `3TK-68`, not two.

### Numbering, and a deliberate discontinuity

`3TK-65` and `3TK-66` keep their numbers, because nothing is renumbered and  
`3tk-decisions-007.md` cites by id — 3TK-63 already showed what a renumbering  
costs there. The new stages take `3TK-67`, `3TK-68`, `3TK-69`.

**So execution order and numeric order differ on purpose: 67, 65, 66, 68, 69.**  
Written into `029` and the status file in as many words, so no later stage  
"corrects" it. `3TK-67` was preferred over another `3TK-pre-` insertion because  
it rules things of its own — the landing page, the marker, the rules file — and a  
citable number is worth more than a monotonic sequence.

### One thing 3TK-67 carries that is a known hazard

**It both changes a rule and applies it**, which is the shape that produced the  
`wrong_type_must` defect — where the stage's own new check is what caught it. So  
its step 2 rewrites the two superseded checks **before** the sweep, not after.  
That is the standing exemplar rule, and here it is not optional.

### Two more rules, later in the same sitting

**The owner added a second stage rule and corrected the filing of the first.**

**The new one: before every stage, say which model is suitable for performing  
it, and why.** It turns the standing Opus pre-authorisation from a permission  
into an obligation, and makes it **two-way** — a stage that is a mechanical sweep  
against a settled rule says so rather than silently taking the strongest model.  
The basis written down is *how much of the stage is deciding rather than  
applying*, and each charter in `029` now carries its own recommendation.  
**`3TK-68` is the one that asks for less**, which is what stops the rule  
collapsing into "the strongest model, always". It is **advice, not an action**:  
the session names the model, the owner chooses.

**The owner then asked for actual names rather than tiers, and they are pinned:  
`3TK-67`, `3TK-65`, `3TK-66` and `3TK-69` on Opus 5; `3TK-68` on Sonnet 5.** The  
roster they were pinned against is recorded in `Rule 7`, with the clause that  
matters more than the names: **a pinned name that has gone stale is not a reason  
to stall** — the basis governs, the stage picks its nearest equivalent, and it is  
not a design question to bring back to the owner. Without that clause a pinned  
roster becomes a trip-wire the first time the model list moves.

**The correction: both stage rules belong in `3tk-rules-001.md`, not only in the  
status file.** The first cut of Rule 6's test split on *is this about how C3 is  
written* and filed the process rules to `3tk-status.md`. **That was too narrow.**  
The owner's scope for the file was *any rule specific to 3tk not in the common tk  
set*, and a rule that binds every stage is a rule whatever it governs. The  
`binds a future stage and can be checked` test survives; *how 3tk is written* was  
never the whole of it.

**So the file has two parts** — the port rules, how 3tk source is written, and the  
stage rules, how a 3tk stage is run — kept apart because a reader of the published  
repo comes for the first and a session comes for the second. **And nothing is  
stated twice:** the statement lives in `3tk-rules-001.md`, and `3tk-status.md`  
keeps only the operational line a cold session needs.

**`029` was edited in place rather than superseded, and that is deliberate.** The  
rule is that a plan version is not rewritten but superseded — because a charter  
must not shift beneath work already done or citations already made. `029` **had  
run no stage**, nothing cited it, and this contradicts nothing in it; `027` was  
superseded because its charter was *overturned*. Writing a `030` for one added  
rule would spend a plan that never ran, which is the churn the versioning rule  
exists to prevent rather than the discipline it exists to impose.

### What was written

`3tk-staging-plan-029.md`, and `028` to `backup/` with a plain `mv`.  
`3tk-status.md` edited in place — the live section, the stage table in run order,  
*How to start after a clear*, and one new standing rule: **before the first stage  
and after every stage, the session says compact, clear or nothing, unasked and  
with the reason, and a clear comes with the exact prompt.** This entry.

`029` was then edited in place, in the same sitting, to carry `Rule 7` and a  
model recommendation per charter.

**No `.c3` file was touched and no script was run**, so `3TK-pre-65`'s figures  
stand — 89 checks, four builds, 143 tests each, 418 of 418 sentences.

---

## 2026-09-07 — 3TK-pre-65: the readable surface

**Plan 028's first stage, and it ran in one sitting.** Six module names, three  
parts to `inner.c3`, one marker line, and a defect the stage introduced and its  
own new check caught.

### The split, and what it actually cost

`helper.c3` is **`module mtk::helper <Outer>;`** and `queue.c3` is **`module  
mtk::queue;`**, reversing 3TK-63's merge as `Part 4.2a` re-ruled. **65 alias  
sites went from `mtk::OF{X}` to `helper::OF{X}`** — the same length, because C3  
accepts the last segment of a module path.

**The queue cost nothing at all, and the plan's estimate of 47 sites was  
wrong.** C3 imports a module's submodules with it, so `import mtk;` still gives  
`InnerQueue` unqualified — and there was not one `mtk::InnerQueue` spelling in  
the tree to begin with. The estimate had counted every `InnerQueue` reference,  
not the qualified ones.

**The docs site is the proof, read and not assumed.** From the generated page:  
**`mtk` is 36 declarations**, exactly what `4.2a` predicted, `mtk::helper` is  
the only page marked `is_generic`, and `mtk`, `mtk::queue`, `mtk::mailbox` and  
`mtk::pool` are all `is_generic=false`. `Inner`, `Slot` and `InnerQueue` have  
stopped being presented as parameterized by `Outer`.

### The partition, and the owner's ruling that shaped it

The stage's first arrangement sorted `inner.c3` by hideability. **The owner  
replaced the test with a better one:** a declaration belongs to the user only if  
the user has **no other way to write it** — everything `OuterHelper` can do for  
them belongs to the second part.

**A measurement decided where the line falls, and it contradicted the  
assumption behind the helper.** Across `examples/`, comments stripped:

| the helper | calls | | `Inner`/`Slot` directly | calls |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `create` / `release` | 60 / 78 | | `Slot.fill` | 34 |
| `look`, `must_look`, `take`, `must_take` | **0** | | `Slot.must` | 27 |
| `inner`, `stamp`, `linked` | **0** | | `Slot.is_empty` | 18 |

**The helper is an allocator, not a door.** Users reach it for `create` and  
`release` and cross with the Slot's own methods; the four crossings on  
`OuterHelper` are called by `test/` alone. **So the owner ruled the five method  
forms — `Slot.to`, `Slot.must`, `Slot.move`, `Inner.to`, `Inner.as` — stay in  
the first part**, though the helper could do them, because they are 51 of the  
121 direct calls in the book and because `s.must(Holder)` names the type at the  
call site, which is what a dispatch switch needs.

`inner.c3` is now three parts: **`module mtk;` yours**, then **`module mtk;`  
public and not yours**, then **`module mtk @private;`**. The first holds  
`Inner`, `Slot`, the Slot's five operations, `Inner.outer_tid` and the five  
crossing methods. The second holds the eight free crossings and the four chain  
primitives, each with `// For internal usage.`, its `[3tk:]` marks — **kept, on  
the owner's ruling, because `3tk-decisions-007.md` cites them by line** — and  
nothing else. The third holds `inner_offset`.

**`outer_tid` is in the first part for a reason worth writing down:** the helper  
cannot replace it, because a dispatch switch reads an identity **before** it  
knows which type it has, and a helper is bound to one type.

### The marker, and the mistake it caused

**34 declarations across `src/` carry `// For internal usage.` and no `<* *>`  
block.** The seven *"Public because C3 cannot hide a method"* paragraphs are  
withdrawn, and the four *"Internal, so not a `<* *>` block: see 3TK-42"*  
comments became the same one line.

**Then the stage broke a negative and its own new check caught it.** `c3c`  
puts `@require` **inside** the `<* *>` block. Stripping the block from  
`mtk::must_from_inner` stripped `@require is_mine(inner, $Type)` with it, and  
`negative/wrong_type_must` **stopped aborting in a checking build** — two  
failures in 89 checks, in a stage whose whole claim was that nothing moves.  
`to_inner` and `stamp` lost a `@require` the same way and had no negative to  
report it.

**The rule that comes out of it, and it is now enforced:** an internal  
declaration that has a contract keeps a **contract-only** block — every line a  
`@` line, no prose. It describes nothing, reaches neither the reference nor the  
docs site, and keeps the check. **A later reader must not "tidy" one away.**

### Three checks, because the owner asked for one

`run-builds.sh` went **81 → 89**, and every added check is a fact the stage  
would otherwise only have asserted:

1. **The module list, six names** (`Part 4.5`), replacing the two-name layering
   grep — plus one check that `src/` declares nothing outside the list. The old  
   check would have gone red on this stage's correct change, which `Part 4.5`  
   had warned about.
2. **No example reaches past the helper** into the second part of `mtk`, by
   name, with the banners asserted first so the grep cannot fall back to  
   nothing. **Two examples are listed as allowed rather than silently skipped:**  
   `010` asserts that `create` wrote an identity, and `012`'s whole subject is  
   that the free form and the method form agree. `test/` is white-box and  
   exempt by design.
3. **No declaration carries the marker and a describing block at once** — the
   check that found the missing contract, and that now knows a contract-only  
   block is legal.

**Green: 89 checks, 0 failures, four builds, 143 tests each.** The doc loop is  
clean — 4 labelled blocks, 0 differing, **418 of 418 sentences**, 0 banned  
words, `move-module-docs.sh roundtrip` byte-identical. **510 → 418 is the fall  
the stage exists to produce**, and it is the one stage where a falling  
descriptor count is the point.

### Step 4, the trim, and what the rule turned out to mean

**`OuterHelper.release` was the exemplar and was shown before the pass**, as the  
standing rule requires. Four more blocks followed: `OuterHelper`, `inner`,  
`stamp` and `create`. **Nothing was deleted** — every sentence moved was already  
in the reference, which is what a clean doc loop proves and why the trim is safe  
to run mechanically.

**What left the source is the argument.** Why the carrier is a `typedef` over  
`uptr` and not an empty struct; why no member reads `self`; why the member is  
called `stamp` and not `init`; why `create` returns `void?` and `release` does  
not. **What stayed is what a caller needs at the call site**, and the line  
between the two is narrower than "behaviour versus reasoning": `create`'s  
*"Stamping after the hook is deliberate: if `init` fails the outer was never  
stamped, so a pointer that escaped a failed creation can never be mistaken for a  
live outer"* is an argument in its first clause and a **fact a caller must know**  
in the rest, so it stayed as *"If `init` fails the outer was never stamped, so a  
pointer that escaped a failed creation can never be mistaken for a live outer."*

**A shortened sentence still matches**, because `check-doc-loop.sh` tests  
containment against the reference rather than equality — so trimming a clause  
off the front of a sentence costs nothing, while rewording its middle would have  
been a miss. That is worth knowing before the next trim.

### Two smaller things

**`@local` does not work on `inner_offset`, and it was probed rather than  
assumed.** With `@local`, `inner.c3`'s own macros fail to resolve the name —  
*"'inner_offset' could not be found"*. `@private` by section default is the only  
lever. That closes Step 5: `@local` fits nothing in `src/`.

**`_Mbox` moved to the end of `mailbox.c3`**, so the file has the same  
public-before-private shape `pool.c3` already had.

### The documents

**`3tk-reference-008.md` was edited in place** in `matryoshka-3tk`: the  
six-module table and why the merge was reversed, a `mtk::queue` labelled block  
(**four labelled blocks now**), a `mtk::helper` description carried as prose —  
the doc-loop parser matches `module X;` and a generic module line is not that  
shape — *"Public, and why"* rewritten around the marker rule and the accepted  
gap, and a new *"What of `module mtk` is yours"* stating the owner's test.

**`matryoshka-3tk/scripts/run-builds.sh` is tuned to match**, and the `diff` is  
the `ROOT` line alone. **The three `.yml` files needed no change:** CI is the  
matrix, and nothing in it names a module.

**Not yet copied to `matryoshka-3tk`'s `src`/`test`/`negative`/`examples`, or  
pushed** — that is the owner's step, and 3TK-62, 3TK-63, 3TK-64 and the INTR are  
all waiting in the same batch.

**The stage is complete.** Plan 028's `3TK-65` is next and its charter is  
unchanged; what 3TK-pre-65 leaves it is written into *How to start after a  
clear*.

---

## 2026-09-07 — DESIGN: the readable surface, and the merge reversed

**A sitting, not a stage. No code changed.** It wrote plan 027, reopened  
`Part 4.2`, and settled four questions with probes instead of argument.

**It began with the source and ended with the docs site.** The owner read  
`helper.c3` and `inner.c3` — *"both are absolutely non-readable"*, *"I don't  
understand which methods/functions/macros are public for client and which are  
not"* — and later the generated site: *"mtk is non-readable, lot of methods  
functions macros — combining inner/helper created documentation mess."* The  
second complaint turned out to be the same complaint, one artifact further  
along.

### The four probes

**One: methods cannot be hidden, by any attribute.** `@private` **and `@local`  
are both ignored**, and c3c says so rather than failing — *"'@private' modifiers  
are ignored for method declarations"*, *"'@local' modifiers are ignored"* — with  
the call succeeding from another module. **`Part 4.4` was right as written, and  
this log corrects the sitting's own earlier claim** that `MANUAL.md:12893`  
implied otherwise. It does not; the source was right and the reading was wrong.

**Two: a separate module hides `inner_offset` just as well.** `module  
core::helper <Outer>;` calling `core::to_inner` compiles and runs, while a third  
module reaching for `core::inner_offset` is refused. That is the mechanism  
`mtk::pool` has used all along — a macro body resolves against its defining  
module — and **3TK-63 had probed it itself.**

**Three: `c3c docgen` ignores visibility entirely.** `@private` and `@local`  
declarations are published; `_Mbox`, `_Pool` and `InnerStack` appear **as public  
types**, with `enqueue`, `bucket_for`, `take_back`, `push`, `pop` and both  
`@guard_insert`s beside them. **3TK-58's opaque containers are undone on the  
site.** A declaration with no doc block is still listed, with an empty  
description.

**Four: the short module prefix works.** `alias MSG = helper::OF{Msg};`  
compiles and runs.

### What the probes cost the design

**`Part 4.2` is reopened and re-ruled: the merge is reversed.** `helper.c3`  
becomes `module mtk::helper <Outer>;` and `queue.c3` becomes  
`module mtk::queue;`. The measured case is in `4.2a`, and it is short: docgen  
groups by module and by nothing else, so `mtk` is **59 declarations on one flat  
page** with `is_empty`, `take`, `to` and `stamp` each listed two or three times;  
and because one section is generic, **the whole page is marked  
`is_generic: true, generic_parameters: ["Outer"]`** — `Inner`, `Slot` and  
`InnerQueue` presented as parameterized by a type they have nothing to do with.  
That last one arrived with 3TK-64, not 3TK-63.

**Against which the merge bought one symbol.** `Part 4.3` listed four things  
worth hiding; it conceded two of them itself (`is_linked` and `reset`, forced  
public by the stack ruling), `Part 4.4` conceded the third (methods), and probe  
two took the fourth. **`Part 4.3`'s sentence *"C3 can express that sentence only  
as a module"* is false**, and 4.3 is marked superseded rather than deleted,  
because what was believed is what a later reader needs.

**`mtk` ends at 36 declarations. `OuterHelper` keeps its name** — owner's  
ruling; it appears 13 times in `helper.c3` and in no other `.c3` file, never  
qualified, so `mtk::helper::OuterHelper` would occur in zero lines of code,  
while `Helper` alone would stutter worse and say less. **`InnerStack` is  
untouched** — *"it's private, that's all."*

### The rule the sitting is actually for

**The doc block is the visibility marker.** C3 offers no way to tell the docs  
site what is not yours to call; docgen carries two signals only, the module and  
the presence of a doc block. So a declaration that is not the user surface takes  
`//` line comments and no `<* *>` block, **whether or not the compiler can hide  
it** — which sorts by *audience* instead of by *hideability*, and that is the  
distinction the withdrawn text failed at. `Inner.outer_tid` and every `Slot.*`  
are unhideable **and** user surface, so they keep their blocks;  
`Inner.repoint_to` is unhideable and not user surface, so it loses its.

One lever, three artifacts: the source loses seven paragraphs, the reference  
never receives the declaration, the site shows a bare signature.

**The marker is `// For internal usage.`** — the owner's wording, chosen over  
the proposed *"Not the user surface"*. **It must not say "inner":** `Inner` is a  
type and one of the only two terms, so *"for inner usage"* on `Inner.points_to`  
reads as being about `Inner`.

### An accepted gap, and a trap for the stage

**The names still appear.** `_Mbox`, `_Pool` and `InnerStack` stay listed on the  
docs site, undescribed. Docgen has no visibility filter and no exclude flag, and  
a curated file list does not help because every file mixes surface and  
internals. **Undescribed, not absent — accepted by the owner, and no stage goes  
looking for a way around it.** Same shape as the CI gap.

**And `run-builds.sh:215` fails on the correct change.** It asserts  
`^module mtk::$f;` for exactly `mailbox` and `pool`; the list is now six. **It  
moves in the same pass as the split** — which is precisely the trap `Part 4.5`  
already spells out for the stack, arriving a second time.

### What was written

**`3tk-staging-plan-028.md`**, with `3TK-pre-65` ahead of `3TK-65` and nothing  
renumbered — the owner's name for it, stating both its position and that it was  
inserted, and leaving `3tk-decisions-007.md`'s citations alone.  
`3tk-boundaries-001.md` gained `4.2a`, `4.2b` and `4.4a`.

**Two plan versions were spent in one sitting, and the second is the sitting's  
own doing.** `027` was written first, declaring `3TK-pre-65` as a  
source-and-comments stage; then the docs site was read, the probes ran, and  
`Part 4.2` was reopened, which gave the stage a module split, answered its  
Step 1 before it ran and emptied its Step 5. **That is a different charter, so  
`027` was superseded rather than edited** — a plan version is not rewritten in  
place. `026` and `027` both moved to `backup/` with a plain `mv`, joining  
019–025. **027 ran no stage**, the same way 025 did not.

## 2026-09-07 — INTR: the state comes out of `OuterHelper`

**Owner-initiated, between 3TK-64 and 3TK-65, and not a stage.** The owner read  
`helper.c3` and made two claims: `typeid outer_tid` is never used, and `self` is  
never used. **Both were true**, and a grep settled them in one pass — the only  
other matches on `outer_tid` are `Inner.outer_tid()`, a different symbol.

**`self` stays, because it is structural.** C3 has no static-method facility,  
and `MANUAL.md` §6_14_5 aliases parameterized types, functions and globals but  
never a module — there is no `alias MSG = mtk{Msg};`. The carrier exists to give  
C3's ordinary method syntax a receiver, which is the only way a generic module  
offers members under one bound name. Removing `self` would have changed the  
surface at all 65 alias sites.

**The field goes, and its removal is not tidying.** The doc block spent five  
lines forbidding a maintainer from writing  
`if (inner.outer_tid() == self.outer_tid)`. With no field that line cannot be  
written, so the rule stops needing to be stated. The field was written once by  
the `const` initialiser and read by nothing.

### The spelling was decided by a compile, not by a preference

The owner put the question to another model, whose advice was right about the  
shape — *a zero-state type-level facade*, keep the carrier, don't hunt for an  
obscure attribute — and **wrong about the syntax it recommended first.**  
`struct OuterHelper {}` does not compile:

```
Error: Zero sized structs are not permitted.
```

**The standard library already spells this exact shape, and it is not a  
struct.** `lib/std/core/allocators/libc_allocator.c3:10` and  
`null_allocator.c3:3` are both `typedef X (Allocator) = uptr;` with  
`const X VAL = {};` and methods taking `&self` that never read it — zero-state  
carriers, the same thing `OuterHelper` is. A scratch probe confirmed the shape  
holds inside a generic module: `typedef Carrier = uptr;`, `const Carrier C = {};`,  
macro methods, and `alias M = probe::C{Msg};` all compile, with `M.make()` typed  
`Msg*` and `J.make()` typed `Job*` from the same declaration.

So `helper.c3` now reads:

```c3
typedef OuterHelper = uptr;

const OuterHelper OF = {};
```

**Worth recording about the advice itself:** it reasoned correctly about what  
the language lacks and guessed at what it has. On a language this small that is  
the failure mode to expect, and the compile is cheap enough that no advice about  
C3 syntax should be taken without one.

### What it cost

**Nothing at the surface.** The nine member bodies are untouched — they never  
referenced `self` — and no call site changed. Three edits in `src/helper.c3`,  
and one paragraph in `3tk-reference-008.md` rewritten to match, since the doc  
loop correlates the block. The reference never printed the declaration itself,  
so nothing else there moved.

**`run-builds.sh` green — 81 checks, four builds, 143 tests each**, identical to  
3TK-64 in every figure, which is the proof a no-surface-change edit should  
leave. **Doc loop clean — 0 differing blocks, 510 of 510 sentences, 0 banned  
words.** 509 → 510 is the rewritten block, which is one sentence longer.

**One mishap, and it is the stored rule again.** `mkdir -p $D && cd $D` was  
written with a scratch directory that already existed as a *file*; `mkdir`  
failed, the `&&` aborted the `cd`, and two heredocs on the following lines wrote  
`probe.c3` and `main.c3` into the repository root. They were removed at once and  
`git status` confirms the root is clean. **A failed `cd` still does not stop the  
next statement**, and this is the second time in two sittings.

## 2026-09-07 — 3TK-64: `OuterHelper`, and the end of *managed*

**The one stage of plan 026 where semantics change, and they changed.**  
`helper.c3` is refilled as **`module mtk <Outer>;`** — the same module name in  
its generic form, which C3 permits (`A.6`) — carrying  
`struct OuterHelper { typeid outer_tid; }` and `const OuterHelper OF`. A user  
binds one alias per outer type, `alias MSG = mtk::OF{Msg};`, and that is the  
whole ceremony. **`managed.c3` is deleted**, `required_alloc_offset` with it,  
and the word *managed* survives in no name in `src/`, `test/` or `negative/`.

**`run-builds.sh` is green — 81 checks, four builds, 143 tests each.** The  
count fell from 89 because **two compile-time negatives were retired**, four  
builds apart: `nocompile_managed_no_allocator` and  
`nocompile_managed_two_allocators` asserted that an outer without exactly one  
`Allocator` field does not compile, and there is no allocator-field concept  
left to assert. **Both shapes must now compile *and run*, so the proof became  
positive** — `an_outer_needs_no_allocator_field` and  
`two_allocator_fields_are_the_outers_business` in `test/t_helper.c3`. The test  
count rose from 134 to 143 for the same reason: `t_managed.c3` is gone and  
`t_helper.c3` is larger than it was.

### Three things this stage decided that the documents left open

**One: `mtk::init` is renamed `mtk::stamp`, at about sixty call sites.**  
`Part 3.3` rules that the helper's member is called `stamp` *"because `init`  
now belongs to the user"* — but it says nothing about the macro underneath,  
and leaving that one called `init` would have put two opposite meanings on one  
word inside one module: `mtk::init(&m)` writes the identity, `Msg.init(a)` is  
the user's constructor hook. They resolve differently and would never have  
collided in the compiler. They would have collided in every reader. The sweep  
is mechanical and the compiler caught every miss.

**Two: an alias is per-module ceremony, and that is a language fact rather  
than a preference.** `examples/outers.c3` was given `EVENT`, `SENSOR` and  
`HOLDER` beside the three shared structs, and c3c refused every use of them:  
*"Aliases from other modules must be prefixed with the module name, please use  
`outers::HOLDER` instead."* So a shared alias buys nothing — the prefix is as  
long as the alias — and **each of the 44 example modules now carries its own  
one-line alias for each outer type it uses**, which is what `Part 3.1`'s *"one  
alias per Outer type"* means in practice. `outers.c3` says so where the  
aliases used to be.

**Three: the containers took their `@private` alias, and `to_inner` did not.**  
`Part 4.6` says `_Mbox` and `_Pool` are Outers and ordinary clients of the  
helper. Both now declare `alias MBOX @private = mtk::OF{_Mbox};` (the  
attribute goes *before* the `=`, which cost one build) and cross through it —  
except `mailbox::to_inner` and `pool::to_inner`, which keep the read-only  
`mtk::to_inner`. **The helper has no non-stamping way out of an `Outer*` by  
design**, and this is the one direction crossed concurrently: a user turning a  
live `Mailbox*` into an `Inner*` to send it does so while other threads are  
using that mailbox. The stamp writes the bytes it finds, but it writes them.  
Both sites carry the reason.

### What the sweep actually touched

**61 `create` and 78 `release` call sites**, as plan 026 measured, plus the  
ones in `test/`. `create` was mechanical: the type argument becomes the alias  
and the allocator stays where it was. **`release` was not**, because it now  
takes an allocator and about forty of its call sites had none in scope — they  
sat in `fn void free_outer(Slot* s)` helpers, in `on_close` hooks, and in  
thread entry functions reached through a `void*`. Each was given one honestly:  
**an `Allocator` parameter where the function was a local helper** (a dozen  
files), **a field on the context struct** where a thread main reached it  
through `arg` (033, 034, 036), **`self.alloc`** inside a hook object that  
already carried one, and **`mem`** in `test/`, which is what every `create`  
there already used. **No site was given an allocator it was not created with.**

`Event`, `Sensor`, `Holder` and the tests' `Holder` keep their `Allocator`  
field and now fill it themselves, in an `init` hook of their own — which is  
exactly what `Part 2.2` says an outer that wants one does, and it means the  
hook path is exercised by every example rather than by a test alone.

**`057-the_allocator_in_the_outer.c3` had its subject reversed and was  
rewritten, not renamed.** It taught *"release needs no allocator handed back to  
it"*, which is now false. It teaches the true neighbouring thing: the outer  
keeps the allocator only because its own hook put it there, and nothing in 3tk  
reads that field.

### The books

**The doc loop is clean — 3 labelled blocks, 0 differing, 509 of 509  
sentences, 0 banned words, and `move-module-docs.sh roundtrip`  
byte-identical.** `3tk-reference-008.md` was edited in place again, under the  
ruling that covered 3TK-62 and 3TK-63:

- **`#### mtk::managed` is now a four-line gravestone.** A labelled block for a
  module that does not exist is not stale, it is wrong, so the block went and  
  the heading says when and where its sentences moved.
- **`The API — allocating an outer for you` was replaced by `The API — the
  helper`**, carrying every one of `helper.c3`'s descriptor sentences, and it  
  says in its first lines that the rest of the book still shows the macros  
  directly and that **3TK-66 makes every part lead with the helper.** Parts 1  
  to 7 still spell `managed::create` in their prose and worked examples; that  
  is 3TK-66's charter and not this stage's, and the doc loop does not read  
  prose.
- **`The API — identity` documents `stamp` and `Inner.outer_tid`**, with the
  `Part 5.1` reason attached: the write rebuilds the whole `any` to preserve  
  `link.ptr`, and the destructive edit differs from it by one sub-expression.

**Two banned words were caught in text this stage wrote and rewritten by this  
stage** — *idempotent*, twice, in `helper.c3` and `inner.c3`, and *underneath*  
once in the reference. Nothing pre-existing was touched.

### The other repo

**`matryoshka-3tk/scripts/run-builds.sh` is tuned to match** — the two retired  
entries and the comment saying why. Copied and the `ROOT` line re-applied; the  
`diff` is that one line and nothing else. **The other three scripts needed no  
change**, and their diffs are the `ROOT` line alone as well.

**The three `.yml` files needed no change** — but the first version of this  
entry gave a wrong reason for it, and the owner caught it. It said they *"invoke  
the scripts by name"*. **They do not.** `linux.yml` re-implements `c3c build mtk`
+ `c3c test` inline across a four-leg matrix; `sanitizers.yml` runs `c3c test`
under a sanitizer; `docs.yml` runs `c3c docgen`. **Nothing in CI runs  
`scripts/run-builds.sh`**, so no negative program and no layering grep is  
checked on push. **The 3TK-62 entry in this log already said so** — the claim  
was not merely unchecked, it contradicted a stage that had got it right.

**That was put to the owner and ruled, 2026-09-07: CI is the matrix, and the  
matrix is enough.** Every failure is visible as its own leg, which one serial  
script job would bury. **The negatives stay hand-run.** This is an accepted gap  
and not an oversight, and it is written here so a later reader can tell the two  
apart. The `scripts/` copy is still carried across every stage, because the  
owner runs it by hand in that repo.

**`docgen` was checked rather than assumed:** `c3c docgen --emit-stdlib=no src`  
against the new sources exits 0 and renders all nine `OuterHelper` members with  
`mtk::managed` gone. **A generic module section does not confuse it.**

**Three dead files were removed from `matryoshka-3tk` with a plain `rm`**, on  
the owner's word, because a copy adds files and never deletes them:  
`test/t_managed.c3`, which would have failed `c3c test` on all four legs, and  
the two `negative/nocompile_managed_*.c3`. A tree comparison found exactly those  
three and nothing else.


### The fold into `3tk-decisions-007.md`

**Done in this stage, and the restore was skipped on the owner's word.** The  
plan makes each build stage fold its own entries out of *"Ruled by 3TK-61,  
decided and not yet built"* into the body with real `file:line`. 3TK-64 owns the  
largest group: `RT-3`, `RT-5`, `RT-6` … `RT-10`, `RT-12` … `RT-18`, and `HR-5`.

**The parked section now holds no live ahead-of-the-source decision.** What is  
left is `RT-1` (a governing principle, not a `file:line` claim), the four `MS-1`  
measurements, and four entries already marked RULED or DISCHARGED.

**Two corrections the fold had to make:**
- **The heading said `### The helper — 3TK-65`.** That is plan **025**'s
  numbering, never renumbered when 025 was spent. Plan 026 made **3TK-64** the  
  helper and 3TK-65 the safe-build checks.
- **`RT-7` and `RT-8` named the field `otrid`.** It was built as **`outer_tid`**,
  following Boundaries `Part 3.1`, the later document. The body carries the name  
  that is in the source.

**Four entries elsewhere in the body named modules that no longer exist** —  
`mtk::managed` twice, `mtk::helper` once, and `required_alloc_offset`'s two `P2`  
entries. All four are now marked SUPERSEDED, REVISED or DELETED rather than  
removed, because a port may have read them. **`## managed.c3` is kept as a  
deletion record**, not as documentation of a file.

**One entry outlived its module and is recorded as doing so.** `E7`/`H0b` — *the  
distinction lives at the call site, and no type declares itself managed* — is  
still true with the module gone: no type declares itself anything, and the alias  
line is a binding, not a declaration of kind.

**The restore was not run, and the file's header now says why.** The owner ruled  
it not worth a git command: 189 of the 222 changed lines were the botched  
renumbering, every citation is stale after 3TK-64 anyway, 21 name a deleted file,  
and **3TK-66 re-anchors all 222 from the built tree in one pass.** The header  
tells a reader to treat any citation older than 3TK-64 as naming a file and not  
a line. **The entries this stage wrote carry correct lines.**

**Not yet copied to `matryoshka-3tk`'s `src`/`test`/`negative`/`examples`, or  
pushed** — that is the owner's step.

---

## 2026-09-07 — 3TK-63: the merge into `mtk`

**Eight module names become four, and the reason is one C3 fact.** `@private`  
reaches the module and nothing else — not a submodule, not the parent, and C3  
has no package or friend visibility (Boundaries `A.1`). So *"who may touch a  
chain"* has exactly one spelling available: **do we share a module?** The  
crossings and the two containers are the only code entitled to the chain  
internals, so they must share one. `inner.c3` absorbed `helper.c3`'s crossing  
macros and became `module mtk;`, `queue.c3` became `module mtk;`, and  
`helper.c3` was **emptied and kept** — 3TK-64 refills it as  
`module mtk <Outer>;`.

**Pure relocation, and the numbers are the proof: `run-builds.sh` green,  
89 checks, four builds, 134 tests each — identical to 3TK-62 in every figure.**  
That is the same proof 3TK-60 used for a rename.

### What was hidden, and what it cost

`inner_offset` is **`@private`**, and it was probed rather than assumed: a  
throwaway `module probe;` that calls `mtk::inner_offset` now fails with *"The  
macro `mtk::inner_offset` is `@private` and not visible from other modules"*,  
while `mtk::pool` and `mtk::mailbox` still expand `to_inner` and `from_inner`  
without complaint. **A macro body resolves against its defining module**, so  
hiding the offset macro does not hide the crossings that use it — the one fact  
this whole arrangement depends on, and it holds.

`reset` and `is_linked` **stay public**, exactly as `Part 4.3` predicted:  
`InnerStack` calls both from `mtk::pool`, a submodule, which cannot see this  
module's privates. They take a *"public because"* doc line naming that reason.

**Two tests had to stop reaching for `inner_offset`** —  
`t_identity.c3:inner_at_any_offset` and  
`t_managed.c3:only_the_owning_type_pays`. Both now read the offset the only way  
a caller outside `module mtk` can: the distance `to_inner` puts between an outer  
and its inner. **Same number, taken through the surface** — the same move  
3TK-58 made when `is_quiet()` replaced five `_active` reads. **No test was lost  
and none was added: 134 before, 134 after.**

### The unhideable-method line, written once — and where it was NOT written

`Part 4.4`'s sentence went onto `Inner.repoint_to`, `Inner.points_to` and both  
`@guard_insert` macros, in one wording, in one pass.

**It was not written onto `Slot`'s methods, and that is a deviation from  
`Part 4.4`, made deliberately.** The sentence ends *"It is not part of the user  
surface"*, and for `Slot` that is false: `examples/` calls `.fill` 34 times,  
`.is_empty` 20, `.is_full` 8 and `.peek` 9, and the pool's `create` hook fills  
a Slot by design. `Slot`'s methods are public **by intent**, not by the  
language's failure to hide them, so the apology does not apply to them. The  
`Part 4.4` table is right about *hideability* and wrong about *the sentence*.  
**The rule reads as a rule precisely because it is only on the declarations it  
is true of.**

### `required_alloc_offset` moved instead of dying

Plan 026 said it is *"deleted here, not in 3TK-64"* because *"it has no caller  
once `managed.c3` goes"* — but `managed.c3` goes in **3TK-64**, and until then  
it has two callers, `managed.c3:68` and `:88`. **The plan's clause is right  
about the destination and wrong about the date.**

It was **moved into `managed.c3` and made `@local`**. The concept leaves the  
core in this stage, as the plan intended, and it leaves the codebase in 3TK-64  
when the file that now owns it is deleted. `@local` is the owner's own lever  
here: they marked `InnerStack` `@local` in `pool.c3` before this stage started,  
and the same reach — this file and nothing else — is exactly right for a macro  
whose one caller is two declarations below it.

**Its message changed, and so did one `run-builds.sh` expectation.** The old  
text said *"use mtk::helper instead of mtk::managed"*, naming a module this  
stage abolished, and `NOCOMPILE_EXPECT[nocompile_managed_no_allocator]` grepped  
the build output for the string `mtk::helper`. The message now says *"allocate  
the outer yourself"* and the expectation is **`Plain`**, the type name — which  
is what the other three compile-time negatives already expected. **The check  
count did not move.** 3TK-64 retires the program entirely.

### The doc loop learned what a section is

Three files now declare `module mtk;`, and `check-doc-loop.sh` diffed each of  
them against the reference's single `mtk` block — two guaranteed failures on a  
correct change. **The same shape of trap 3TK-62 met at `run-builds.sh:230`, and  
narrowing it was again a design act, not a suppression.**

The rule written into both scripts: **a module has one description however many  
sections it is written in.** The carrier is the file with a `<* *>` above its  
module line; the others carry a `//` banner saying they are sections and where  
the description lives. `check-doc-loop.sh` reports those as *section only, no  
block* and, in the same pass, **asserts that every labelled block is carried by  
exactly one file** — so a description cannot vanish by every section deciding it  
belongs elsewhere. `move_module_docs.py`'s `sources()` became a choice rather  
than a lookup and **stops with an error on two carriers**; without that it wrote  
the merged `mtk` block into `queue.c3`, purely because `q` sorts after `m`. That  
happened once here and was undone.

**`mtk::inner`, `mtk::helper` and `mtk::queue` are gone from the reference as  
labelled blocks and their prose is inside `mtk`'s.** Blocks go **7 → 4**; plan  
026 said *"loses four module blocks"*, and it is three — the fourth,  
`mtk::managed`, goes with 3TK-64.

### `PL-10` closed, and it was five lines and a block, not one sentence

The status file was right and the plan was not. `inner.c3` carried a `DIFFERS`  
block and five `MISSING` sentences — the four-line *"Contains all for"* file  
header and the `struct Inner` descriptor *"The inner, the Slot, the link test,  
and the port's check macro."* **All six went in one move**: the file header's  
prose is now inside the reference's `mtk` block, `inner.c3` has no module block  
to differ, and the struct descriptor is the reference's own  
*"`Inner` is the field you embed."*

**`check-doc-loop.sh`: 4 labelled blocks, 0 differing, 476 of 476  
sentences, 0 banned words. `move-module-docs.sh roundtrip` is byte-identical.**  
The first fully clean doc loop of the 3tk line.

### The books

`3tk-reference-008.md` was edited in place again, under the same ruling that  
covered 3TK-62 — 3TK-66 rewrites the books wholesale, so a `009` for this would  
be spent unread. The module table now shows one module over three files, the  
*Usual flow* import list lost `import mtk::helper;`, the compile-time reflection  
section carries the two visibility markers, and a new subsection under *The API  
— the link* — *"Public, and why"* — states the rule the source's doc lines  
repeat.

### One thing this stage broke and did not repair

**`matryoshka-3tk/design/3tk-decisions-007.md` needs restoring from git before  
its 3TK-63 edits can land, and that is the owner's command to run.**

The three edits it wanted are small and correct: fold `RT-2` out of the  
ahead-of-the-source section, correct `RT-13`'s date for  
`required_alloc_offset`, and **reverse the entry that says *"`helper.c3` is not  
a wall: `mtk::inner_offset` is public"*** — which the merge made false.

What went wrong is the fourth thing, which was not asked for. The file carries  
**94 `file:line` citations into `inner.c3`, `helper.c3` and `queue.c3`**, and  
every line in all three moved. Re-anchoring them looked mechanical and was  
attempted in three passes: exact line text (26 of 94), then nearest declaration  
below (a further 20), then a hand-written map for the rest. **The third pass  
matched on the old line numbers and so rewrote citations the first two passes  
had already corrected**, collapsing many distinct targets onto one. The damage  
is not reversible from the file, because the mapping is many-to-one.

**The lesson is the one 3TK-62 wrote about `sed` and the banner, in a different  
costume: a rewrite whose input is its own previous output must be done in one  
pass or not at all.** The prose edits are re-applied by  
`design/secondary/lang/c3/reapply_decisions.py`, and it asserts on  
each of the three blocks so it refuses to run against an unrestored file.

**The renumbering is not retried. It is recorded as debt for 3TK-66**, which  
rewrites the books and re-anchors from the built tree in one pass. The  
*claims* in those three sections are true of the source; only the coordinates  
are stale, and the restored file says so.

### Scripts and CI

`matryoshka-3tk/scripts/run-builds.sh` was tuned in the same stage, per the  
owner's 2026-09-07 rule: one line, the `nocompile_managed_no_allocator`  
expectation, and it is now identical to this repo's but for the `ROOT` line that  
is meant to differ. **The doc-loop scripts have no copy in that repo**, so  
nothing carried across for them. **The three `.yml` files needed no change** —  
none of them names a file, a module or a test count, the same reason 3TK-62  
gave.

---

## 2026-09-07 — 3TK-62: the stack goes into the pool

**The first build stage of plan 026, and the first `src/` change since 3TK-60.**  
`src/stack.c3` is deleted as a file and its content is the last section of  
`src/pool.c3`, inside `module mtk::pool;`, under a comment banner and **not** a  
second module line. `test/t_stack.c3` is deleted. **This reverses 3TK-45**  
("stack is public", 2026-08-26): `InnerStack` is no longer a name a user can  
reach.

**`run-builds.sh` is green — 89 checks, four builds, 134 tests each.** The  
count is **down from 141**, and that is the expected shape of this stage:  
`t_stack.c3`'s seven tests go with the file. Nothing replaced them, and nothing  
needed to. The stack's one *observable* promise — that reuse is last-in  
first-out — was already tested black-box through the pool  
(`test/t_pool.c3:545-593`, `R11`), which is why `RT-4` could be ruled at all.  
The other six tests reached `InnerStack` directly, which is precisely the  
reach this stage removes. **A test that can only be written from outside a  
boundary the design just closed is not a test that was lost.**

**The check count is up from 87 to 89, and those two new checks are the  
interesting part of the stage.**

### The trap, and how it was defused — and how it nearly was not

`run-builds.sh:230` asserted that `mailbox.c3` and `pool.c3` contain no  
`@guard_insert`, `.repoint_to`, `any_make` or `.link =` — a container reaching  
around the container surface. The grep works on `pool.c3` as a **file**, and  
the stack **is** the surface: it uses `@guard_insert` and `.repoint_to` by  
right. So the moment the stack landed, the check went red on a correct change,  
exactly as plan 026 and Boundaries `Part 4.5` predicted. It was seen on the  
first run, from a build started before the move and finishing after it.

**Narrowing it is a design act, not a suppression.** Boundaries `Part 4.5`  
records this grep as the *only* enforcement there is, because `@private` is  
ignored on method declarations, so what replaces it must still be an  
enforcement. `pool.c3` is now cut at the stack banner and only the **container  
half** — every line above it, all of `_Pool` — is grepped, with `mailbox.c3`  
grepped whole as before. The narrowing was tested by planting a `.repoint_to`  
in `Pool.put` and confirming the half reports it.

**And the banner's presence is asserted before the cut, which is the new  
check.** A grep narrowed by a marker fails silently when the marker moves —  
this file's own comment has said since 3TK-18 what happens when a spelling  
moves and the grep does not: *the check goes on printing ok for ever.*

**It then did exactly that, once, before anyone had finished writing the  
warning.** The first narrowing used `sed -e "/$STACK_BANNER/,\$d"`, and the  
banner contains `//`, which collides with sed's own address delimiter. sed  
errored, the container half came out **empty**, and the grep printed `ok`  
against nothing. It is `awk` now, and the half's own size is asserted too —  
two checks where the plan asked for one, because the first was not enough.

### What else moved

- `stack.c3:11`, *"A caller who wants a stack declares one"*, lived only in the
  file-header block, which was the `mtk::stack` module block and did not move.  
  It is gone with the module.
- `mtk.c3:20`, *"a caller may use either one directly"*, now reads *"a caller
  may use the queue directly"*, with *"The stack is private to the pool."*  
  after it.
- The struct block gained one sentence: *"It lives inside `mtk::pool` and is
  not a name a user can reach."*
- `pool.c3:116` and `pool.c3:126` (`InnerStack free;`) became intra-file, as
  the plan said, and needed no change — neither was ever qualified.
- `pool.c3`'s import footer gained `import mtk::inner;` — the stack calls
  `mtk::inner::reset` and `mtk::inner::is_linked`. **That is the price  
  Boundaries `Part 4.3` names**: `mtk::pool` is a submodule and cannot see  
  `mtk`'s privates, so those two free functions cannot become `@private`.  
  3TK-63 writes them the *"public because"* line.
- `t_pool.c3:551`'s sentence about the free list being an `InnerStack` stays
  true and stays.
- `project.json` needed **no change**: it lists `src/**`, not modules. The
  doc-loop scripts derive the module list from the sources, so they needed none  
  either. What the plan called *"the doc-loop module list"* is the reference's  
  own module table.

### The reference, edited in place

**Owner's ruling, 2026-09-07: `3tk-reference-008.md` is edited in place, not  
versioned.** Three sentences and one block, with 3TK-66 rewriting the books  
wholesale anyway, did not earn a `009` that would be spent within the week.

Four edits: the *"What it is not"* bullet and the `mtk` module block both lose  
*"a caller may use either one directly"* and gain *"The stack is private to the  
pool."*; the module table loses its `mtk::stack` row and gains a **REVISED by  
3TK-62** line above the 3TK-46 one; Part 3's *The API — the stack* has its  
*"a caller who wants a stack declares one"* withdrawn in place, and says why  
the API is still documented — **the book explains the pool, which is built on  
it, not because it is yours to call**; and the `mtk::stack` labelled block is  
deleted.

**`check-doc-loop.sh`: 7 labelled blocks where there were 8**, which is the  
*"one module block fewer"* the plan asked for, and **0 banned words**. All three  
sentences this stage wrote are found, and the `mtk` block no longer DIFFERS.

**What remains is pre-existing and is 3TK-63's**, and it is bigger than plan 026  
says. The plan calls `PL-10` *"the one still-missing doc-loop sentence."* It is  
in fact **five lines and a differing block**, all in `inner.c3`: its header  
block opens *"Contains all for / - embedding an Inner / - moving it / - through  
the type-erased toolkit"* where the reference still has *"The inner, the Slot,  
and the link"*, and the descriptor *"The inner, the Slot, the link test, and the  
port's check macro"* is absent. Untouched by this stage — `inner.c3` was not  
opened — and recorded here so 3TK-63 is not surprised by the size of it.

### The other repo's scripts, and a new standing rule

**The owner ruled mid-stage, 2026-09-07:** every stage tunes  
`matryoshka-3tk/scripts/` and `matryoshka-3tk/.github/workflows/` to what it  
changed in `matryoshka-tk`, **as part of the stage**. It is in plan 026's  
*Standing constraints* and in the status file.

**The reason it cannot be a follow-up** is visible in this stage exactly. That  
repo's `scripts/run-builds.sh` carried the un-narrowed layering grep. The  
moment the owner copies `src/pool.c3` across, that grep sees `@guard_insert`  
and `.repoint_to` in `pool.c3` and goes red — **on a correct change, in the  
repo where CI runs, at the one moment nobody is looking for it.** The trap this  
stage defused in one repo was still armed in the other.

**The port turned out to be one line.** All four scripts there —  
`run-builds.sh`, `run-builds-light.sh`, `run-sanitizers.sh`, `preview-docs.sh`  
— are byte-identical to this repo's copies except that `ROOT` gains `/..`,  
because they sit in `scripts/` and not at the tree root. So the procedure is  
copy, re-apply that line, and `diff`: the ROOT line being the only difference  
**is** the verification. Done for `run-builds.sh`; the other three were not  
touched by this stage and needed nothing.

**`check-doc-loop.sh`, `move-module-docs.sh` and their two Python modules are  
not ported and should not be.** They read the reference book by a relative path  
out of `matryoshka-tk`, and the doc loop belongs where the documents are edited.

**The three `.yml` files needed no change, and that is a considered no.**  
`linux.yml` runs `c3c build` and `c3c test` directly and names no file, no  
module and no test count, so a deleted `stack.c3` and a count of 134 are  
invisible to it. `sanitizers.yml` the same. `docs.yml` filters on `src/**` and  
`examples/**`, and everything this stage touched is still under `src/`.

**One thing found while looking, and it is not this stage's to fix.** **CI does  
not run `run-builds.sh` at all.** `linux.yml` runs `c3c build` and `c3c test`  
and nothing else, so the 89 checks — every negative program, the layering grep,  
the submodule assertions — exist only when the owner runs the script by hand.  
The scripts in `matryoshka-3tk/scripts/` are local tooling, not the CI  
contract. Recorded here rather than acted on; it is the owner's call whether a  
workflow should invoke the script.

### The repair of `3tk-decisions-007.md`

Plan 026 gave 3TK-62 the whole of the first pass, so that no stage after it  
reads a false `007`.

- **The stack entries are folded into the body** — a section named *The stack,
  at the end of `pool.c3`* — with real `file:line`, and **deleted from the  
  ahead-of-the-source section**. The 3TK-45 entry that said the stack *"is  
  available to a caller like the queue"* is withdrawn in place, and the  
  reversal carries what made it available, what it cost, and what it did not  
  cost.
- **Four false citations corrected**, marked **SUPERSEDED** rather than
  deleted, because a port may have read them already: `xtn` (never exists),  
  the allocator field (no such concept; `required_alloc_offset` is deleted  
  outright), `create`/`release` living outside the core (they are members of  
  `OuterHelper`, in the core), and the stutter listed as open (ruled — the  
  crossing is `mtk::to_inner`). Two module names in `RT-2`/`RT-3` were  
  superseded in the same pass, since eight names became four.
- The section's pointer to `3tk-rethinking-001.md`, a document that no longer
  exists, now points at `3tk-boundaries-001.md` and names its id scheme.

## 2026-09-06 — 3TK-61 continued: the proposal, and four more measurements

**The same stage, the same day, a second sitting, and again no `src/` change.**  
The entry below ended with *"three points are the owner's before the building  
starts."* The owner asked for the first of them — the shape of `OuterHelper` —  
to be **proposed** rather than left as a question, then asked two further  
questions that turned out to be structural. **The three points are now fifteen  
questions, and every one of them is smaller than the three were.**

Everything is in
[matryoshka-3tk/design/3tk-rethinking-003.md](https://github.com/g41797/matryoshka-3tk/blob/main/design/3tk-rethinking-003.md).
`001` and `002` are in `matryoshka-3tk/design/backup/`. New ids: **`HS-n`** a  
proposed element of the shape, **`V-n`** a variant, **`Q-n`** a question the  
owner answers. **Sections 10-15 propose; `MS-6`..`MS-9` measure.**

### The shape — sections 10, 11, 12

**Nine members in three groups, plus two in `xtn`.** The Slot crossings  
`must`/`look`/`take` (55 of MS-1's 59 method sites), the `Inner*` crossings  
`from`/`must_from` with the predicate `owns` for the `switch` RT-17 blesses,  
and outward `inner`/`init`. `create` and `release` live on the `xtn` helper,  
which embeds the base one `inline` so **one alias still reaches all ten**.  
Named for what the caller gets and what it costs the container — `look` and  
`take` name the two postconditions, which is the one thing a reader must not  
have to guess.

**`HR-5` is discharged by `HS-10`:** `inner()` stamps the identity  
idempotently, writing `.type` only. `Inner.link` is an `any`, so a stamp that  
touches `.type` alone is safe on a **linked** inner as well as an unlinked one  
— which is what makes the idempotence real rather than a promise about call  
order. The natural maintenance edit, `inner.link = any_make(null, …)`, silently  
unlinks a linked outer, so the reason is written into the file beside the rule.

**Five variants with recommendations and named fallbacks**, and two  
measurements were *owed rather than run*, because the sitting wrote no code:  
`MS-4` and `MS-5`. **`Q-5` pre-answers the case where `MS-5` fails**, so a  
probe cannot stall 3TK-65.

### Then the owner asked how the internals stay internal — section 13

**`MS-6` measured C3's visibility and the natural assumption is wrong.**  
`@private` reaches **the module and nothing else** — not a submodule, not the  
parent. There is no package or friend visibility in C3. So "internal to mtk,  
hidden from clients" cannot be expressed across a module boundary at all; the  
only lever is **which symbols share a module**, and the only thing that makes  
it workable is that a C3 module may span many files.

**`MS-7` probed the shape that follows and it compiled, linked and ran:** a  
generic module declaring `OuterHelper`, aliased in another module on a  
**`@private`** struct, with its members forwarding to **`@private`** macros of  
the base module. Both halves hold — the helper reaches them, a client cannot  
and fails to compile naming one. The probe carried the real `$Type::members`  
offset walk, so its round trip is a result and not a zero-offset coincidence.

**And the finding that reshaped the section: the mailbox and the pool are  
already clients of the helper.** `_Mbox` and `_Pool` are Outers, crossing at  
six sites. So **`PL-7` stops being a matter of taste and becomes a  
precondition** — if the crossings go private those six sites stop compiling,  
and the containers cannot join the module because `mtk::mailbox::create` and  
`mtk::pool::create` collide. **`queue.c3` joins for free**: nothing outside  
`src/` spells `queue::` and nothing anywhere imports `mtk::queue`, so the chain  
mutations can go private too. `RT-3`'s module name is the price.

**`MS-8` fell out of the probing and corrected the document seven times:  
`Outer.typeid` does not compile anywhere.** The spelling is `Outer::typeid`.

### Then how the outer's fields are found — section 14

The owner asked whether the `Inner` is found by type or by the name `inner`,  
and whether an outer may carry several `Allocator`s with only `alloc` being  
set. **`MS-9` measured both; both work.** `$m.name` matching and a default  
macro parameter carry it, and the failure message improves from *"type X has no  
Inner field"* to *"type X must declare exactly one `Inner inner;`"* — the fix  
rather than the symptom.

**The allocator half removes a real limitation.** `RT-12`/`RT-13` say the field  
is optional and exists for the outer's own later allocations, yet an outer that  
keeps **two** cannot be created today. **This amends `RT-13`: found twice is  
now also an answer.** The hazard is that the reclassification is **silent** —  
`Allocator a;` in `examples/035-fan_in.c3` and `Allocator inner;` in  
`test/t_alloc.c3`, a test that exists to prove the name does *not* matter and  
now asserts the opposite. The mitigation was written into the proposal rather  
than left as a follow-up: `xtn::create` refuses at compile time when an outer  
carries an `Allocator` but none named `alloc`.

**The inner half costs zero example changes** — 15 of 15 outers already write  
`Inner inner;` — and **amends `Part 4.4`**. "Several inners" was split into two  
features: `V-7a`, other `Inner` fields are yours and ignored, and `V-7b`, an  
outer on several chains at once. `V-7b`'s mechanism works; its cost is the  
surface section 10 had just finished shrinking. **`V-7a` forecloses nothing**,  
because the default parameter serves both.

### Then how it is all used — section 15

Written against a file that exists, `examples/006-defer_put_early.c3`. The  
user's ceremony is one alias; `mtk::managed::create(Holder, self.alloc, slot)`  
becomes `HOLDER.create(self.alloc, slot)`, and **the type name stops being an  
argument and becomes the receiver.** The mailbox and the pool do exactly the  
same thing, on a `@private` alias each, and their six sites become six lines.

**Two corrections came out of writing it down.** `init` was recorded as the  
member the proposal was least sure of, on the evidence of **zero** user calls;  
it has zero *user* sites and **two mtk-internal ones**, `mailbox.c3:95` and  
`pool.c3:193`. **`Q-6` is answered and `V-5` stops being narrow.** And the  
section closes on the argument neither section 13 nor `RT-6` had made: **the  
user's surface and mtk's own surface are the same surface** — a toolkit whose  
own containers are ordinary clients of its public helper has no second,  
privileged way to use itself.

### What this sitting did not do

**No code.** The owner's line was *proposal only*, and it held for the shape;  
the four measurements are probes in a scratch directory, not `src/` changes.  
**No stage moved.** Sections 13, 14 and 15 all land inside 3TK-63, 3TK-64 and  
3TK-65 as already ordered, and none of them earns a stage of its own. **Plan  
025 is unchanged except for its links.**

**Three rulings are re-opened and are the owner's alone:** `RT-3`'s module name  
(`Q-10`), `RT-11`/`PL-7` (`Q-11`), and `RT-13`'s *found twice is an error*  
(`Q-14`). No stage may assume any of them.

---

## 2026-09-06 — 3TK-61: the rethinking, and it changed no code

**3TK-61 was declared in plan 024 as one subject — `managed.c3` pushing an  
`Allocator` field onto every Outer — with the escape clause *"a **62** if it  
turns out structural."* It turned out structural.** The owner expanded it in  
session into a general rethinking of the core's shape, ruled most of it, and the  
stage ended as an analysis: **no `src/` change, and `run-builds.sh` untouched.**

Everything it settled is in
[matryoshka-3tk/design/3tk-rethinking-001.md](https://github.com/g41797/matryoshka-3tk/blob/main/design/3tk-rethinking-001.md),
written by id — `RT-n` a ruling, `HR-n` a helper requirement, `PL-n` the parking  
lot, `MS-n` a measurement — so a later stage cites an id instead of re-arguing  
the point. The build stages are in
[3tk-staging-plan-025.md](backup/3tk-staging-plan-025.md).

### What the owner ruled

**`OuterHelper` is a first-class citizen.** `struct OuterHelper { typeid otrid;  
}`, in `helper.c3`, module `mtk::helper` — the books lead with it and the macros  
become the layer beneath. Its state is the **type identity**, not the allocator:  
it mirrors ztk's per-instantiation `_tag` static, which is Zig compensating for  
having no runtime type identity, and C3 uses the real `typeid` instead. The  
owner accepts that `otrid` is writable — c3c 0.8.3 has no field-level privacy —  
because removing the `init` trap is worth more; the free mitigation was taken as  
a rule, that no member ever reads `self.otrid` to decide anything.

**`inner.c3` absorbs the old `helper.c3` content**, and `helper.c3` survives to  
be refilled by the helper. **`stack.c3` becomes private** at the end of  
`pool.c3`, `t_stack.c3` is deleted, and that **reverses 3TK-45**. **`managed.c3`  
leaves the core** into module `xtn` under `3tk/extensions/`, a folder the owner  
created for it, named to sort after `mtk` in the documentation — **and the word  
*managed* survives in no name.**

**Governing all of it, restated with force over the design and not only over the  
examples: an Outer is a long-lived heap object, and a user who does otherwise  
pays.** It decides that `create` is the blessed path and that the stage must  
*not* design defensively for stack or uninitialized outers — while keeping the  
distinction that **catching is not supporting**: an illegal use should still  
abort loudly in a safe build.

**The allocator stops being stored.** `create` takes it — it allocates, so it  
must — and so does `release`. The `Allocator` field in an Outer becomes  
**optional**, and its purpose is the **Outer's own** later allocations, not a  
no-argument `release`. `required_alloc_offset` becomes an optional discovery and  
moves to `xtn`. This is a **port deviation being undone**: ztk never stores the  
allocator, and 3tk only did so to reach a `release` with no argument.

### The two measurements, and both were worth running

**MS-1 — the user's vocabulary is six spellings.** Across the 52 files of  
`examples/`: `managed::release` 78, `managed::create` 61, `.must(` 26, `.to(`  
25, `.move(` 4, `.as(` 4, and one each of `helper::is_mine` and  
`helper::from_inner`. **200 sites, and what is absent decided more than what is  
present:**

- **`init` is called zero times.** `create` does it, 61 times. The trap the
  helper was partly meant to close is already closed for every outer a user  
  creates — which, under the heap rule, is every legal outer.
- **The free Slot forms are dead in user code** — `from_slot` 1,
  `must_from_slot` 0, `move_from_slot` 0, `must_from_inner` 0. Users reach for  
  the **method** forms, **59 sites to 8**. So "bless one set" has an  
  evidence-backed answer: bless the methods.
- **The receiver is almost always a Slot** — about 50 of the 59 method calls.
  Users meet a bare `Inner*` only when dispatching. The container calls agree:  
  `send` 31, `put` 23, `get` 22, `receive` 21.
- **Tests are the mirror image and are not user evidence** — `to_inner` 79,
  `init` 63, `from_slot` 31 — because they probe the primitives on purpose.

**MS-2 — and it proved one of the stage's own claims wrong.** Probed on c3c  
0.8.3:

1. **C3 has no struct default field initializers.** `struct Cfg { int a = 7; }`
   does not parse. The "defaults declared on the type" half of the ruling is  
   unavailable and must not be planned for.
2. **The allocator already zeroes.** `alloc::new`/`new_try` take an optional
   `#init` and, when it is not supplied, allocate with `calloc`  
   (`std/core/alloc.c3:182-187`); verified at runtime. **So  
   `managed::create`'s existing `alloc::new_try(a, $Type)!` is already  
   zero-initializing, and the comparison's claim that 3tk leaves the outer  
   undefined where ztk does `item.* = .{}` was false.** `PL-3` was recorded as  
   closed rather than deleted, so nobody raises it again.
3. **`#init` is an opportunity, not just a detail.** `mem::new(Cfg, { .a = 7 })`
   works, so `create` can accept an optional initializer and forward it — the  
   user sets non-default values *at creation* instead of remembering to fill  
   them afterwards.

### What was dropped, and by whom

**The owner dropped a dispatch construct** — users expect a `switch` and are  
content writing one — so the one remaining raw `link.type` read stays as it is.  
**The owner also ruled that `t_stack.c3` needs no replacement**: the stack is  
inner machinery, the pool is what cares, and the LIFO promise is already tested  
black-box in `t_pool.c3`.

**Three ztk shapes were identified as Zig workarounds and are not gaps in 3tk**:  
`PolyTag`/`TAG`/`isIt`, which exist because Zig has no `typeid`; per-type  
instantiation, which is why ztk's helper body is written out twice for one  
opt-out; and, against them, 3tk's exact `is_linked`, which is a genuine  
improvement over ztk's documented blind spot. **A rule was written for every  
later stage that reads `polynode.zig`: separate ztk's intent from Zig's  
workarounds.**

**One real gap survived the comparison and is parked**, not fixed: ztk asserts  
an item has no neighbours before it leaves a Slot, and 3tk's `move_from_slot`  
and `release` assert nothing (`PL-1`). So is the second insert guard — ztk walks  
the list *and* checks `is_linked`; 3tk only checks `is_linked`. The owner asked  
for the walk in debug builds, and the reason it differs was recorded: ztk needs  
it because its `is_linked` is blind to a list's sole member, whereas 3tk's  
exact test means the walk guards **chain corruption**, not double-insert  
(`PL-2`).

### The decisions file, and why its new section runs ahead of the source

**`3tk-decisions-007.md` was written, and `006` moved to  
`matryoshka-3tk/design/backup/`.** It carries a section the file has never had  
before — **"Ruled by 3TK-61, decided and not yet built"** — because the file's  
own rule is that it must not contradict `../3tk/src`, and every entry in its body  
carries a `file:line`. A stage that ruled the shape of the core and changed no  
code has decisions with **no line to cite**.

**How it is discharged:** each build stage folds its own entries into the body  
with real `file:line` **and deletes them from that section.** When the section  
is empty the rethinking is built, and the section goes with it. The four live  
citers — `3tk-status.md`, `3tk-open-defects.md`, `ref/3tk-doc-loop-004.md` and  
`3tk-api-004.md` — were repointed in the same step. **The log's own 3TK-60 entry  
still cites `006`, and correctly: it is the record of what that stage wrote.**

### Why it ends here

**Eleven workstreams had accumulated, and several were design rather than  
execution** — the helper's member list did not exist yet, so no sweep could be  
written for it. Plan 024's own escape clause applied, and the stage stopped at  
the line it drew. **Plan 025 orders the building** so that each stage can be  
*proved* rather than believed: the stack first because it is self-contained, the  
relocation second because it must return identical numbers, the semantics third  
and alone, the helper fourth, and the books and examples last.

**Three points are the owner's before the building starts**: the  
`inner::to_inner` stutter the merge creates, where `create`/`release` live given  
that the core is meant to allocate nothing, and the proposed member list itself.

---

## 2026-09-04 — 3TK-60: the two terms

**3tk has exactly two terms, `Inner` and `Outer`, and the words *handle* and  
*item* are gone from the source, the tests, the negatives, the examples and  
every book.** `to_handle`/`from_handle`/`must_from_handle` are  
`to_inner`/`from_inner`/`must_from_inner`. The stage is a rename and nothing  
else: `run-builds.sh` returns **87 checks, 0 failures, four builds green, 140  
tests each** — identical to 3TK-59, as a change with no semantics must be.

**It supersedes 3TK-59's decision to keep *handle* as an English word.** That  
stage removed `alias Handle = Inner*` and ruled *a concept gets a C3 type when  
the type system can express useful semantics for it; otherwise it stays  
vocabulary.* Under the two-term ruling *handle* is a third term naming nothing  
the pair does not: it was the old word for `Inner*`, and *item* the old word  
for an outer.

**`Slot` is untouched**, and the terms document says why: it is a real type  
naming a container state, not a participant.

### The owner's ruling mid-stage: `inner`, not `n`

**Plan 024's own rename table wrote `from_inner(Inner* n, $Type)`.** At the  
checkpoint the owner asked why `n` and not something spelled out. Three facts  
settled it:

1. **The other half of the pair is the full word.** Spelling one `outer` and
   the other `n` hides the pair the stage exists to establish.
2. **The tree already spelled the embedded field `node`** — 14 declarations
   across `test/`, `examples/` and `negative/`. That is a *third term*, in the  
   same position *handle* held, and the ruling admits no third term. It was  
   not in the plan's scope; the owner ruled it in.
3. **`inner` does not collide with the module `mtk::inner`.** Measured on c3c
   0.8.3 before the ruling: a parameter, a local and a struct field all named  
   `inner` compile, link and run with `import mtk::inner` in scope, because C3  
   keeps module paths and value identifiers in separate namespaces. **The  
   abbreviation bought nothing.**

**Ruled: `inner` everywhere** — parameters, locals, and the embedded field.  
`struct Msg { Inner inner; int v; }`.

### One deviation from the plan, and why

**The plan put the checkpoint before anything mechanical ran.** Renaming the  
three crossing macros in `helper.c3` alone left the tree with 40 failures —  
nothing to verify and a bad place to stop. **The three identifiers were swept  
tree-wide before the checkpoint, and nothing else**, so the owner reviewed the  
exemplar against a green build. Everything the checkpoint guards — the prose,  
the tests, the books — was held.

### What the sweep found that a mechanical pass would have broken

- **`h` is not always an `Inner*`.** `TestHooks h`, `ConcurrentHooks h` and
  `LateCloseHooks h` are hooks structs, 24 sites. The rename was scoped per  
  function body — a block gets `h` → `inner` only if it declares `Inner* h` —  
  and two files are genuinely mixed (`t_pool.c3`, `t_concurrency.c3`, two  
  `Inner* h` each). Three `Holder* h` locals in `examples/` became `outer`.
- **`3tk-api-003.md` was stale, and a word sweep would have hidden it.** It
  still documented `### alias Handle = Inner*` and said "`Handle` is an alias  
  for `Inner*`" — a declaration 3TK-59 deleted. Renaming the word would have  
  produced `alias Inner = Inner*`, a false statement about a type that exists.  
  **The entry is deleted in `004`**, the signatures spell `Inner*`, and the  
  methods preamble now gives the real reason the crossings are declared on  
  `Inner`: C3 has no UFCS and a method cannot be attached to a pointer alias.
- **A decisions record must keep the name of what it deleted.** The 3TK-59
  entry in `3tk-decisions-006.md` keeps `alias Handle = Inner*` in backticks,  
  because it explains why *that declaration* went. Retiring a word forward does  
  not license rewriting the record of it. Same for the ztk row (`ItemHandle`)  
  and `D8`'s superseded names (`AnyNode`, `AnyHandle`).
- **The reference's Participants block had been written around *handle*** in
  3TK-59 and the sweep turned it into "a **inner**" and "*Inner* is a word in  
  these books and not a type in the source" — false, since `Inner` is a type.  
  Rewritten by hand, and it now states the model outright:

  > You send and receive your own struct. To get that, you give the
  > infrastructure one thing: an `Inner` embedded in it. From then on the
  > infrastructure never sees your type — it moves `Inner*`, intrusively and
  > type-erased. You get your struct back by crossing once, from `Inner*` to
  > `Outer*`, and the identity in the `Inner` is what makes that crossing safe.

  The same statement opens `3tk-terms-001.md` and the `mtk::helper` and  
  `mtk::inner` module blocks.
- **Articles.** *a handle* → *an inner*, and `node`→`inner` produced "a inner"
  twice in the reference. Swept and checked with a dedicated grep.
- **Reflowing the reference broke the doc loop.** Rewrapping long lines
  rewrote six module-description blocks and `check-doc-loop.sh` reported **6  
  differing blocks**; `./move-module-docs.sh out` restored them byte-exact.  
  A module description is copied, never composed — including its line breaks.

### The doc loop came out better than the plan allowed

The plan permitted the one pre-existing `managed.c3` `DIFFERS` block and the  
two pre-existing missing sentences to persist. **`move-module-docs.sh out`  
closed the `DIFFERS` block and one of the two missing sentences** as a side  
effect of copying the new descriptions across. Final: **0 differing blocks,  
471 of 472 sentences found, 0 banned words.** The one still missing is the  
pre-existing `inner.c3` struct-descriptor summary, which is 3TK-61's.

### Also done, because it was in the way

**Both scripts defaulted `REF` to `../ref/3tk-reference-004.md`**, four  
versions dead, so every invocation needed `REF=` on the command line. They now  
default to `matryoshka-3tk/design/3tk-reference-008.md` and run bare.  
`check-doc-loop.sh`'s comment quoting the banned-word rule was reworded off  
*item* and `Handle`.

### Versions written, and what moved

New, all in `matryoshka-3tk/design/`: **`3tk-terms-001.md`** (new),  
**`3tk-reference-008.md`**, **`3tk-patterns-004.md`**,  
**`3tk-example-rules-004.md`**, **`3tk-api-004.md`**,  
**`3tk-decisions-006.md`**. The last two changed repo: `ref/3tk-api-003.md`  
and `ref/3tk-decisions-005.md` moved to `c3/backup/`, and the stray  
`ref/3tk-api-002.md` with them. **`ref/` now holds only  
`3tk-doc-loop-004.md`.** `007`/`003`/`003` moved to  
`matryoshka-3tk/design/backup/`. Cross-references were repointed in the same  
step — `ref/3tk-doc-loop-004.md`, `3tk-open-defects.md` and the books' own  
links.

**Not yet copied to `matryoshka-3tk`'s `src`/`test`/`negative`/`examples`, or  
pushed** — that is the owner's step. The design documents were written  
directly in `matryoshka-3tk/design/`.

## 2026-09-04 — 3TK-59: the `Handle` alias removed, the word kept

**`alias Handle = Inner*;` is gone from `3tk/src/inner.c3`**, and every one of  
the 130 whole-word `Handle` sites under `3tk/` is now either `Inner*` or  
English prose. `typedef Slot = Inner*;` is the only handle-adjacent  
declaration left.

**The ruling the stage was run on**, from the owner's objection that the  
`Slot`/`Handle`/`Inner*` model is hard for an ordinary developer: *a concept  
gets a C3 type when the type system can express useful semantics for it;  
otherwise it stays vocabulary.* `Slot` is a `typedef` — empty or full, `fill`  
requires empty and refuses null, `take` empties it — and earns a type name.  
`Handle` was an `alias`, so the compiler only ever saw `Inner*`: it refused no  
assignment, refused no null, detected no stale pointer, and said nothing about  
who frees the outer.

**The word survives, and *porting is not transpiling* is why.** The  
specification describes the role; each port spells it as its type system  
allows — ztk `Handle`/`ItemHandle`, C3 `Inner*`, dtk to be decided. Nothing in  
the shared specification or in  
`kitchen/docs/addendums/handle-based-programming.md` was touched.

**How the mechanical half was done, and what it could not do.** An `awk` pass  
substituted `Handle` → `Inner*` on every line *outside* a `<* … *>` doc  
comment, across `src/`, `test/`, `examples/` and `negative/`; the 16 sites it  
left were then rewritten by hand. **Two of those 16 were not prose and would  
have been silent defects if the pass had been trusted blindly**: `helper.c3`'s  
`@require is_mine((Handle)self, $Type)` is a compiled contract that happens to  
live inside a doc comment, and `pool.c3`'s module block carries a ```c3 fence  
whose `while (Handle h = batch.pop_front())` line the reference mirrors  
verbatim. Both were corrected.

**One deletion the plan named as its own evidence.**  
`test/t_identity.c3:164`'s comment — *`Handle` is an alias for `Inner*`, so  
the crossings are reachable as methods* — existed only to explain the  
mismatch the alias caused. It is replaced by a sentence that states where the  
crossings are declared and needs no explanation of an alias.

**The `[3tk: D4, R1, Part 10.1]` marker line went with the alias**, and  
nothing was lost: `struct Inner`'s own marker line already reads `D1 to D16,  
R1 to R15, Part 4, Part 9, Part 10.1`, which subsumes all three.

**Three documents were written.**

- **`3tk-reference-007.md`**, in `matryoshka-3tk/design/`, from 51 sites.
  Part 3's *Participants* lost the `Handle` bullet and gained one that names  
  `Inner*` and says *handle* is a word in the books and not a type in the  
  source. The signature blocks needed no re-alignment: `Handle` and `Inner*`  
  are both six characters. The stale note under Part 5's `mtk::pool` about the  
  `mtk::Handle` spelling 3TK-47 corrected was rewritten into the past tense.  
  **`006`'s own version banner still read "This is 005"** — 3TK-58 did not  
  bump it — so `007`'s banner describes both `006` and `007`. `006` moved to  
  that repo's `backup/` with a plain `mv`.
- **`3tk-patterns-003.md`**, from 22 sites, 15 of which were the walk
  declaration. No pattern changed; only the spelling.
- **`ref/3tk-decisions-005.md`**, carrying the ruling as an entry under
  *Vocabulary and shape*, with `Slot` and `Handle` as the worked pair and dtk  
  named as the port that meets the question next. The three entries that  
  described the alias — *`Handle`, not `InnerHandle`*, *One handle type,  
  transparent*, and *The Slot is distinct, not an alias* — were rewritten,  
  and the `inner.c3` line anchors on the Slot entries were re-measured against  
  the shortened file. `004` moved to `backup/`.

Cross-references were repointed in `ref/3tk-doc-loop-004.md`,  
`ref/3tk-api-003.md`, `3tk-open-defects.md`, and — in `matryoshka-3tk` —  
`3tk-example-rules-003.md`.

**Verification.** `./3tk/run-builds.sh`: **87 checks, 0 failures, four builds  
green, 140 tests each** — identical to 3TK-58, as the plan required of a  
change with no semantics. `./3tk/check-doc-loop.sh` with `REF` at  
`3tk-reference-007.md`: **1 differing module block (`managed.c3`, pre-existing)  
and 462 descriptor sentences, 460 found, 2 missing** — the same two  
pre-existing gaps, confirmed absent from `006` as well. The plan called one of  
them a `helper.c3` sentence; it is in fact `inner.c3`'s *struct Inner*  
descriptor summary, and `helper.c3` is at 44 of 44. **Banned words: 0** in  
every doc comment and in `3tk-reference-007.md`, and the hand scan of  
`3tk-patterns-003.md` and `3tk-decisions-005.md` found nothing this stage  
wrote. The plan's warning about `drain` was heeded; the shape is called a  
**walk** throughout. `grep -rw Handle 3tk/`: **0 in every `.c3` file**. The one  
remaining hit in the tree is a comment in `check-doc-loop.sh` quoting  
`rules-049.md`'s scoped ban on *object*, which names the concept and not the  
type; it stays. `run-sanitizers.sh` was not run, as the plan says it need not be.

**Two pre-existing `hands` hits are in `3tk-decisions-005.md`**, inherited  
from `004` at its `InnerQueue.take()` and pool-close entries. Reported, not  
fixed — `rules-049.md` Part 5 says report and do not fix without approval, and  
its scan scope skips `design/secondary/` anyway.

**Not yet copied to `matryoshka-3tk`'s `src`/`test`, or pushed** — that is the  
owner's step. The three documents were written in place in their own repos.

## 2026-09-03 — 3TK-58: `Mailbox`/`Pool` opaque handles

**`Mailbox` and `Pool` became opaque handles**, following the idiom C3's own  
stdlib uses for `std::thread::channel::UnboundedChannel`: `typedef Mailbox =  
void;` / `typedef Pool = void;` are now the public types, and the real  
fields moved into `@private` structs in the same module — `_Mbox` in  
`mailbox.c3`, `_Pool` in `pool.c3`. Every method's first line casts the  
opaque handle back to the real type; the first parameter, no longer named  
`self` since the type it names is no longer real, is `mbox`/`pool` instead.  
Internal-only helpers (`enqueue`, `dequeue`, `has_queued`, `send_at`,  
`bucket_for`, `take_back`, `take_back_handle`, `_close`, and the  
`@closed_fast` macro) moved to be methods on `_Mbox`/`_Pool` directly, since  
they are only ever called from inside a method that has already cast.  
`TYPE` and `to_handle`/`of` were repointed at `_Mbox`/`_Pool`, since the  
identity a `Handle` carries has to be the real struct's `typeid` — leaving  
`TYPE` as `Mailbox::typeid` after the typedef would have silently made it  
`void`'s typeid instead, which is not what `init()` writes into a mailbox's  
own `Inner.link.type` (that still runs against `_Mbox`/`_Pool` through  
`mtk::helper::init`, taking the real pointer).

**Scope held to `Mailbox`/`Pool` only**, per the plan: `PoolBucket` and the  
core (`PolyNode`/`Inner`) are untouched.

**New API: `Mailbox.is_quiet()` / `Pool.is_quiet()` → `bool`**, returning  
`self._closed && self._active == 0` under the mutex — the same predicate  
`release()` already asserted. Narrower than a raw active-count accessor by  
the owner's call, made in this session before the plan was written.

**Three test files were brought back to black-box, one test dropped.**  
`test/t_mailbox.c3` (two sites) and `test/t_pool.c3` (three sites) read  
`_active == 0` directly; all five became `is_quiet()` calls. One of  
`t_pool.c3`'s three sites (`the_pool_close_then_join_then_release`) checked  
`_active == 0` **before** `close()` ran, while the pool was still open —  
`is_quiet()` requires `_closed` too, so it cannot stand in there. That  
assertion was dropped rather than mistranslated; the test still asserts  
`!p.is_closed()` at that point and moves straight to `close()`, where  
`is_quiet()` picks back up. `t_identity.c3`, read first per the plan, turned  
out to touch none of `Mailbox`/`Pool` at all — its `.node`/`Msg`/`Job`/`Twin`  
lines were never in scope, so nothing there changed.

**`t_concurrency.c3`'s `the_deadline_is_anchored_once` was dropped, not  
rewritten**, exactly as the plan called for: it reached `mb._cv.broadcast()`  
directly to provoke a spurious wakeup, and there is no black-box way to do  
that once `_cv` is unreachable — every public way to signal the condition  
variable changes one of the three things the receive loop checks before  
looping back to wait, so the case the test provoked is structurally  
unreachable from outside the module. Its `spurious_waker` helper went with  
it. Part 2.5, D7 stays documented, not mechanically tested — tracked as the  
"Tests improvements" TODO in `3tk-status.md`.

**Verification.** `./3tk/run-builds.sh`: 87 checks, 0 failures, four builds  
green, 140 tests each (down from 141 — the one dropped test, and nothing  
else). `./3tk/check-doc-loop.sh` against the new  
`matryoshka-3tk/design/3tk-reference-006.md`: 466 descriptor sentences, 464  
found — the 2 missing are the same pre-existing gaps (a `helper.c3` and a  
`managed.c3` module-summary sentence) present against `3tk-reference-005.md`  
before this stage too, confirmed by running the check against both files.  
Module blocks: `mailbox.c3` and `pool.c3` both `same`; the one `DIFFERS`  
(`managed.c3`) is the same pre-existing gap. No `Mailbox{...}` / `Pool{...}`  
struct literal existed anywhere under `3tk/`, so no construction site needed  
updating.

**Reference doc.** `3tk-reference-006.md` written directly in  
`matryoshka-3tk/design/`, per this session's ruling that design docs there  
are editable in place: Parts 4 and 5's Participants sections describe the  
opaque shape (keeping "the tool itself" in the prose so the module-summary  
sentence match against `mailbox.c3`/`pool.c3`'s doc comments still holds),  
every method signature block updated to `(&mbox, ...)` / `(&pool, ...)`,  
`is_quiet` added to both control-API blocks, and the `@closed_fast` note in  
Part 6 repointed at `_Mbox`/`_Pool` since the macro is no longer reachable  
from outside the module at all. `3tk-reference-005.md` moved to that repo's  
`backup/` with a plain `mv`.

**Not yet copied anywhere else or pushed** — `matryoshka-3tk`'s `design/` is  
where the doc was written directly, but `src/`/`test/` changes are only in  
`matryoshka-tk`'s copy, per the standing rule that 3tk source changes go  
there and the owner copies to `matryoshka-3tk` themselves.

## 2026-08-31 — 3TK-57 follow-up: `shc` gets its own module description page

**Found after the `exm`→`shc` rename landed: `shc` rendered in `docs.html`  
with no description page, unlike `mtk`.** `src/mtk.c3` declares bare  
`module mtk;` with a module-level `<* ... *>` doc comment directly above it  
— no symbols required, just the doc block and the module statement — and  
that is what `docgen` turns into `mtk`'s own page. Nothing under  
`examples/` was a bare `module shc;` file: `outers.c3` declares  
`module shc::outers;`, `helpers.c3` declares `module shc::helpers;`, every  
numbered example declares `module shc::<name>;` — all submodules, none the  
parent.

**Added `examples/shc.c3`**, mirroring `mtk.c3`'s shape but with no SPDX  
header — the plain example files don't carry one either, only `mtk.c3` does  
as the library's own file. Just a module-level doc comment (purpose: a  
pattern catalog for `mtk`, not part of the library; how to use it: one file  
one pattern, `shc::outers`/`shc::helpers` as shared infrastructure; the nine  
catalog theme groups named in one line) then bare `module shc;`, no code.

**Verified:** regenerated `docs.html` and confirmed `shc`'s module entry now  
carries the doc text, same shape as `mtk`'s. `run-builds.sh` re-run clean  
afterward: 87/87 passed, all four modes green.

**Where this ran.** Done only in `matryoshka-tk`'s copy  
(`design/secondary/lang/c3/3tk/examples/shc.c3`), per the standing rule —  
the owner copies to `matryoshka-3tk` themselves.

## 2026-08-31 — 3TK-57 follow-up: examples module renamed `exm` to `shc`

**`docs.html`'s generated module list is plain alphabetical — `c3c docgen`  
has no ordering flag, and the display order comes from a hard `.sort()` baked  
into the JS the tool writes into `docs.html` on every run  
(`moduleNames = [...new Set(allDecls.map(d => d.moduleName))].sort();`),  
confirmed by reading the generated output directly rather than assumed.**  
Tested `--append` as a possible workaround first: it does insert  
`EMBEDDED_JSON_LIST` entries in call order, but the final module list is  
always rebuilt and re-sorted after merging, so append order has no effect —  
`exm` still landed before `mtk` either way.

**Owner's decision: rename the examples module `exm` → `shc`** ("showcase",  
matching `mtk`'s 3-letter convention) rather than post-process `docs.html`  
after every generation. The blast radius was checked before deciding: all 52  
occurrences of `exm::` were confined to `examples/*.c3`, `test/t_examples.c3`,  
and one reference in `3tk-example-rules-003.md` — nothing under `src/`. A  
permanent naming fix, not an ongoing script to maintain against future c3c  
upgrades.

**Done:** `exm::` → `shc::` across all 52 files (bounded token replace, no  
other identifier collided), `3tk-example-rules-003.md` updated to match.  
`run-builds.sh` re-run clean afterward: 87/87 passed, all four modes green —  
confirmed the rename is cosmetic (module name only), not a behavior change.  
Regenerated `docs.html` and confirmed every `mtk`/`mtk::*` entry now sorts  
before every `shc::*` entry.

**Where this ran, and the correction that followed.** The rename (and the  
regenerated `docs.html` check) was first done directly in `matryoshka-3tk`,  
alongside 3TK-57's CI workflow files. **The owner corrected this: 3tk source  
changes belong in `matryoshka-tk`'s own copy at  
`design/secondary/lang/c3/3tk/` only — the owner copies to `matryoshka-3tk`  
themselves.** That copy-back had already happened by the time work resumed  
here; this repo's copy was found already carrying the rename, same content  
and mtime as `matryoshka-3tk`'s, different inode. The one standing exception  
is CI: `.github/workflows/*.yml` and README CI badges still belong directly  
in `matryoshka-3tk`, per the earlier 3TK-57 correction — that repo owns its  
own Actions and this one does not run CI for 3tk.

## 2026-08-31 — 3TK-57 follow-up: docs.yml now deploys to Pages

**The Pages-collision question 3TK-57 left open is resolved — not by a  
ruling, but by the repo split itself.** The blocker was: *"this repo's Pages  
deployment already belongs to ztk's `docs.yml`. A second workflow calling  
`deploy-pages` without coordination would clobber it."* That was true only  
while both workflows lived in `matryoshka-tk`. Once 3tk's CI moved to its own  
repo, `matryoshka-3tk`, there is no second workflow in the same repo to  
clobber — ztk's Pages deployment is in a different repo entirely.

**`matryoshka-3tk/.github/workflows/docs.yml` gained a `deploy` job**, added  
after the owner reviewed external advice (correct in shape, but guessed at  
`c3c docgen`'s output rather than checking it):

- `docgen` job unchanged through the `c3c docgen --emit-stdlib=no src
  examples` step, still no mkdocs and no `kitchen/tools/*.sh` equivalent —  
  plan 021 was explicit that there is nothing for the docs workflow to wrap  
  beyond that one command.
- A new "Prepare Pages site" step: `mkdir site && cp docs.html
  site/index.html`. `c3c docgen` writes one self-contained `docs.html` into  
  the current directory — `preview-docs.sh`'s own comment says so — not a  
  directory, so `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3` (which needs a directory  
  with `index.html` at its root) can't point at `docs.html` directly.
- `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3` replaces the plain `actions/upload-artifact@v4`
  step; a separate `deploy` job (`needs: docgen`, `permissions: {pages:  
  write, id-token: write}`, `environment: github-pages`) calls  
  `actions/deploy-pages@v4`.

**Still the owner's step, not run here:** enabling Pages on `matryoshka-3tk`  
(Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions) before the workflow's `deploy`  
job can succeed.

## 2026-08-31 — 3TK-57: GitHub Actions CI, built in `matryoshka-3tk`

Plan 021 declared `.github/workflows/3tk-linux.yml`, `3tk-sanitizers.yml`,  
`3tk-docs.yml` and README badges here, in `matryoshka-tk`, scoped with  
`paths:`/`working-directory` to `design/secondary/lang/c3/3tk/**` — the same  
pattern ztk's own workflows use in this repo.

**The owner corrected that placement mid-stage: every 3tk workflow belongs in  
`matryoshka-3tk` (local path `~/dev/root/github.com/g41797/matryoshka-3tk`),  
not here.** That repo is 3tk's own tree — `src/`, `test/`, `negative/`,  
`examples/`, `project.json` and `scripts/{run-builds,run-sanitizers,preview-docs}.sh`  
all live at its root, mirroring how ztk's repo owns its own `.github/`. The  
first draft, written directly into `matryoshka-tk/.github/workflows/`, was  
removed and rewritten there instead.

**Written, in `matryoshka-3tk`:**

- `.github/workflows/linux.yml` — push/pull_request/workflow_dispatch,
  `c3c build mtk` + `c3c test`, matrix `safe:[yes,no] × opt:[O0,O3]`, matching  
  `scripts/run-builds.sh`'s four `MODES`. No `paths:` or  
  `working-directory` needed — the whole repo is 3tk.
- `.github/workflows/sanitizers.yml` — `workflow_dispatch` only, installs
  clang via `apt-get`, then `c3c test --sanitize=<thread|address> --cc clang`  
  for the same three combinations `scripts/run-sanitizers.sh` runs (`thread  
  safe-O0`, `thread fast-O3`, `address safe-O0`), 15-minute timeout per job.
- `.github/workflows/docs.yml` — push to `main` on `src/**`/`examples/**`
  plus `workflow_dispatch`; `c3c docgen --emit-stdlib=no src examples`,  
  uploaded as a build artifact, not deployed to Pages (the open  
  coexistence question with ztk's Pages deployment is unchanged by this).
- Three README badges added to `matryoshka-3tk/README.md`, which had none
  before.

**Installing c3c**, same in every workflow, verified against the live GitHub  
API for `v0.8.3` before being written rather than assumed: the Linux asset is  
`c3-linux.tar.gz`, confirmed to extract to `c3/` containing `c3/c3c` — fetched  
and inspected with `curl`/`tar tzf`, not recalled from memory.

**No stage ran `git`.** All six files (three workflows, one README edit) were  
written directly; nothing was staged, committed, or pushed in either repo. The  
owner saves and pushes both.

**A memory record was added** (`3tk-ci-lives-in-matryoshka-3tk` in Claude's  
memory) so a future 3tk CI/workflow task starts from the corrected repo  
without repeating this correction.

## 2026-08-31 — 3TK-50 step 9: Shutdown, entries 46–48

**Catalog section "Shutdown."** One of the three entries carries a code  
shape and got a file; two do not — 47 (a numbered order plus prose, no  
`c3` block) and 48 (an ASCII diagram, no `c3` block, same as entry 22's  
precedent):

- **46, Reading the fault on a receive.** The catalog's own
  `p46_receive_faults` loop is kept verbatim as the illustration, and three  
  focused functions each provoke one outcome and check it is not mistaken  
  for either of the other two: `timeout_is_not_closed_or_woken` receives on  
  an empty, open mailbox with a 50ms window; `woken_is_not_closed_or_timeout`  
  blocks a receiver thread on a 2000ms window and wakes it from the main  
  thread after it has parked, following entry 32's `Thread`/`Atomic{bool}`  
  shape — calling `wake_all` before a receiver blocks was tried first and  
  found wrong: `_wake_gen` is snapshotted when `receive` starts waiting, so a  
  wake that lands first is invisible to the receive that follows, exactly as  
  entry 47's own wording says (*"a thread that starts waiting afterwards is  
  unaffected"*); `closed_is_not_woken_or_timeout` closes the mailbox first,  
  then receives.
- **47, The shutdown order.** No code shape — a numbered list and a
  rationale, not a shape to instantiate. No file, matching the precedent of  
  entries 21 and 22.
- **48, Shutdown by message.** No code shape — an ASCII flow diagram, not a
  `c3` block. No file, same precedent.

`run-builds.sh` is green — 87 checks, four builds, 131 tests each. Not yet  
copied to `matryoshka-3tk` or pushed — that is the owner's step.

## 2026-08-31 — 3TK-50 step 10 correction: entries 50–53 were missed

**The owner asked where examples 050–056 were.** "Coordinator patterns"  
does not end at entry 49 — it runs through entry 56, and step 10's own log  
entry only covered 49. Re-reading the section found four more entries with  
a code shape: **50, The step; 51, Acquiring the resources; 52, Releasing  
the resources; 53, The thread is given one pointer.** The other three —  
**54, Spawn and join in one step; 55, More than one coordinator; 56, Pool  
and mailbox together** — have no `c3` block (bullets, bullets, and an ASCII  
diagram) and got no file, same precedent as every other bulleted or  
diagrammed entry.

- **50.** `StepMaster.seed_the_work`/`process_the_work` from the catalog,
  kept verbatim; `process_the_work` is `wake_all` and nothing else. Sends  
  four `Event`s and confirms all four crossed by summing their codes after  
  `receive_all`.
- **51.** `master_create` builds a `Master` whose `mbx` and `pool` fields
  are plain pointers, never a Slot to unwrap — the sharpest difference from  
  ztk in the section.
- **52.** `Master.shut_down`, reverse acquisition order, allocation freed
  last. One wrong assumption caught before the build: the first draft put  
  one outer back to the pool and then asked for a second with  
  `AVAILABLE_OR_NEW`, expecting two distinct outers — but `AVAILABLE_OR_NEW`  
  reuses what is free first, so the second `get` handed back the same one  
  and the pool's own remainder at close was empty. Fixed by asking for the  
  second with `NEW_ONLY`, which cannot reuse it.
- **53.** `WorkerCtx` carries a `target` count rather than relying on
  `Mailbox.close` to end the worker's loop — closing before the worker has  
  drained everything sent hands the remainder to `close`'s own out-queue  
  instead of to the worker, a race the shutdown order (entry 47) exists to  
  avoid. The worker instead stops once its own count reaches the target,  
  which is deterministic given the sends happen before the join.

`run-builds.sh` is green — 87 checks, four builds, 141 tests each. Not yet  
copied to `matryoshka-3tk` or pushed — that is the owner's step.

## 2026-08-31 — 3TK-50 step 11: New, and 3tk-only, entries 57–62

**Catalog section "New, and 3tk-only."** Six entries, no ztk entry behind  
any of them (entry 42 belongs here too but sits with the pool patterns and  
already has its file, from step 8). Five of six carry a code shape and each  
got a file; 62 does not — two bullet lists comparing what a fast build stops  
checking, no `c3` block:

- **57, The allocator in the outer.** `Holder` in place of the catalog's
  `Buffer` — every other example already draws its outers from `outers.c3`.  
  Creates, then releases with no allocator argument, confirming the Slot  
  empties.
- **58, An identity costs no registration.** `Event` in place of `Ticket`,
  same reason. Sends a new field value through a mailbox and receives it  
  back unchanged.
- **59, The optional-declaration walk.** `walk_and_release` pairs the
  catalog's counting loop with a release per handle, since the catalog's own  
  `p59_walk` counts and leaks by design — illustrating the idiom, not memory  
  management. Three `Holder`s cross a mailbox as a batch and the walk drains  
  all three.
- **60, Guarding an expensive check.** The catalog's `p60_guarded` kept
  verbatim, run against a one-item batch's handle to show the guard neither  
  aborts nor disturbs it.
- **61, A composite outer gives back its parts.** `PartHooks` kept from the
  catalog, `on_close` taking the queue by value per 3TK-56 rather than the  
  catalog's stale `InnerQueue*` — the same correction step 3 made for entry
  18. `extra` stays empty because `Holder` carries no parts of its own; the
  hook still runs once per `put`.
- **62, What a fast build stops checking.** No code shape — two bullet
  lists, not a shape to instantiate. No file, same precedent as 21, 22, 41,  
  43, 44, 47 and 48.

Two module names collided with c3c's 31-character limit and needed  
shortening from the file's own title — `an_identity_costs_no_registration`  
and `a_composite_outer_gives_back_its_parts` became  
`exm::identity_costs_nothing` and `exm::composite_outer_gives_back`; the  
files keep the full title, only the module declaration inside shortened.  
`run-builds.sh` is green — 87 checks, four builds, 137 tests each. Not yet  
copied to `matryoshka-3tk` or pushed — that is the owner's step.

## 2026-08-31 — 3TK-50 step 10: Coordinator patterns, entry 49

**Catalog section "Coordinator patterns," entry 49, the shapes that carry  
the example rules' own *Two levels* rule.** One file: `049-the_coordinator.c3`,  
following the catalog's `Master`/`run` shape verbatim — `seed_the_work`,  
`process_the_work` and `shut_down` are named steps, and `run`'s own body  
reads as three calls plus one guard, nothing more. `Master` owns both a  
mailbox and a pool and its `shut_down` follows entry 47's order for the two:  
close the mailbox, put back what it kept, release it, then close and release  
the pool.

One defect, found by the build and not before: the wrapper's own  
`typeid[1] tags = { Holder::typeid };` bound to the wrong `Holder` —  
`test/common.c3` declares its own `struct Holder` in `mtk_test`, the  
wrapper's module, and shadowed `exm::outers::Holder`, the one the example  
itself uses. `Pool.get` aborted with *"an identity the pool was not created  
with,"* because the pool's one bucket was tagged with `test/common.c3`'s  
`Holder`, not the one `Master.seed_the_work` asked for. Fixed by qualifying  
the wrapper's tag as `exm::outers::Holder::typeid`. **Every other pool  
example lives inside `examples/`, where only `exm::outers::Holder` is in  
scope — entry 49 is the first place a pool is built in `test/`, which is  
what exposed it.** `run-builds.sh` is green — 87 checks, four builds, 132  
tests each. Not yet copied to `matryoshka-3tk` or pushed — that is the  
owner's step.

## 2026-08-31 — 3TK-50 step 9: Shutdown, entries 46–48

**Catalog section "Pool patterns."** Six of the nine entries carry a code  
shape and each got a file; three do not and got none — 41 (a diagram, no  
code), 43 (prose only, the tool-agnostic reason a hook runs outside the  
lock), and 44 (says outright *Entry 42's `on_close`*, so it names existing  
code rather than shaping new code):

- **37, `AVAILABLE_OR_NEW`.** A `CountingHooks` object counts its own
  `on_get` calls; a put-then-get-again shows the count stays at one, so the  
  kept outer was reused and the hook did not run a second time.
- **38, `NEW_ONLY`.** The same counting hook shows `NEW_ONLY` asks it a
  second time even though the first outer was put back and is free.
- **39, `AVAILABLE_ONLY`.** Two seeded outers drain in a loop that stops on
  the first `catch`; the hook's count is unchanged across the drain, which  
  is the entry's own claim that this path never creates.
- **40, Seeding a fixed-size pool.** A `CappedHooks` object refuses past its
  `cap`, so `AVAILABLE_OR_NEW` past the seed reports `NOT_CREATED` — the  
  seed count is the whole backpressure mechanism, nothing separate enforces  
  it.
- **42, The hook object is the context.** Entry 42's own `CappedHooks` with
  an `Atomic{usz}`, copied as the catalog gives it, to show `self.field`  
  needs no cast the way ztk's `ctx: *anyopaque` did.
- **45, A pool of several identities.** Reuses entry 18's
  `CreateByIdentityHooks` rather than writing a second one — one hook  
  object, three identities, `count_of` confirms each identity keeps to its  
  own free list after a get-then-put round trip.

**One defect found before any build ran, and by inspection, not by a build  
error: entry 45's first draft dispatched an identity out of `on_close` with  
`s.peek().identity()`, a method that does not exist.** `Handle` has no  
`identity()` — the port's own dispatch code reads `h.link.type`, and every  
other `on_close` in the tree that dispatches (14, 18) either uses that or  
reuses another entry's chain. Fixed by reading `h.link.type` before filling  
the Slot, matching entry 17's `free_outer` shape; then 45 was rewritten a  
second time to import entry 18's `CreateByIdentityHooks` outright rather  
than duplicate it.

**One build error surfaced only by `run-builds.sh`: entry 40's own draft  
wrote `return SEEDING_A_FIXED_SIZE_POOL_FAILED?;` to return a fault, the `?`  
operator from some other language's error handling.** 3tk's fault-return  
operator is `~` — a rule already in this file's *Standing facts* — and the  
draft broke its own rule. Fixed to `return SEEDING_A_FIXED_SIZE_POOL_FAILED~;`.

`run-builds.sh` is green — 87 checks, four builds, 130 tests each. **Not yet  
copied to `matryoshka-3tk` or pushed** — that is the owner's step.

---

## 2026-08-31 — 3TK-50 step 7: Topology patterns, entries 33–36

**Catalog section "Topology patterns."** All four entries carry over  
unchanged and none says *no code shape*, but the section's own words —  
"each is a composition of the mailbox patterns above, not a new mechanism;  
the diagrams are the pattern; the code is the mailbox calls already given" —  
mean no new mechanism is demonstrated. Every entry still got a file, in line  
with every earlier "Carries over" entry in this catalog, because a reader  
copies runnable code, not a diagram: `033-request_response.c3`,  
`034-pipeline.c3`, `035-fan_in.c3` and `036-fan_out.c3`, each a real thread  
or threads exercising the mailbox calls entries 27–32 already established.

- **33, Request-Response.** One worker thread loops on a request mailbox,
  doubles the value, and answers on a second, dedicated mailbox. The caller  
  blocks on the response with a timeout — the two-mailbox rule from the  
  entry's own *Why* is the only thing being shown.
- **34, Pipeline.** One stage thread doubles each value crossing it and
  forwards it; an end-of-stream marker (`code == -1`) travels the same  
  mailbox as the values and is forwarded once. The caller drains four  
  messages — three values and the marker — off the output mailbox.
- **35, Fan-In.** Three sender threads, two identities between them (two
  `Event`, one `Holder`), send to one mailbox. `receive_all` plus an  
  outer-first chain — the same shape as entry 17 — empties it in one pass  
  and counts each identity.
- **36, Fan-Out.** Three worker threads compete on one mailbox seeded with
  six `Holder`s, each looping `receive` until `CLOSED`. The caller closes  
  after a short sleep; `close` gives back whatever no worker claimed, and  
  the closer releases it — entry 30's rule, exercised under real  
  contention. Because the example itself closes and releases the mailbox  
  (the close is the thing being demonstrated, as in entry 30's own file),  
  its wrapper creates the mailbox with no `defer`, unlike the other three  
  new wrappers which tear down infrastructure the example never closes.

**No build error, unlike every step since step 1.** `run-builds.sh` is  
green — 87 checks, four builds, 124 tests each. The banned-word scan is  
clean. **Not yet copied to `matryoshka-3tk` or pushed** — that is the  
owner's step.

---

## 2026-08-31 — 3TK-50 step 6: the wrapper rule made explicit, and the two wrappers that broke it

**Out of catalog order.** The owner asked that "the wrapper adds no logic of  
its own" — already a bullet in
[3tk-example-rules-002.md](https://github.com/g41797/matryoshka-3tk/blob/main/design/3tk-example-rules-002.md)'s
"The wrapper in `test/`" section — be made explicit enough to check the tree  
against, and that the tree be checked before the catalog steps continued.

**The rule, spelled out in
[3tk-example-rules-003.md](https://github.com/g41797/matryoshka-3tk/blob/main/design/3tk-example-rules-003.md):**
a wrapper creates and tears down the shared infrastructure an example takes  
as a parameter — that is not logic, since the example does not own a handle  
it was handed. **Touching a `Slot`, a `Handle` or an `InnerQueue` is logic**,  
because doing so demonstrates the pattern a second time, in the one file the  
catalog and any doc tool never reads. Version 003 supersedes 002; the only  
change is this section. `002` moved to `matryoshka-tk`'s `backup/`, and every  
live cross-reference in this repo — `3tk-status.md` and  
`3tk-patterns-002.md`'s own two links — now points at `003`.

**The tree, checked against it: two of the nineteen wrappers written by  
steps 1 through 5 broke the rule.**

- `test_example_insert_from_slot` drained the `InnerQueue` and released each
  `Holder` itself, instead of leaving that to `004-insert_from_slot.c3`. The  
  example now owns its own queue, pushes into it and drains it, so the whole  
  pattern — push from a Slot, then take back out — lives in one file.
- `test_example_reach_into_a_full_slot` received the Slot back off the
  mailbox and released it itself. `016-reach_into_a_full_slot.c3` now  
  receives and releases what it sent, so the round trip the entry  
  demonstrates is complete inside the example.

Both wrappers in `t_examples.c3` are now call-and-assert, and the file's  
`import mtk::managed`, `import std::time` and `import exm::outers` were  
dropped once nothing in the file used them any more.

**No test was added or removed**, so `run-builds.sh`'s test count is  
unchanged at 120 across all four builds; 87 checks pass, four builds green.  
`check-doc-loop.sh` not re-run: `src/` did not change. **Not yet copied to  
`matryoshka-3tk` or pushed** — that is the owner's step.

## 2026-08-31 — 3TK-50 step 5: catalog section "Mailbox patterns"

**Six files, entries 27 through 32** of
[3tk-patterns-002.md](https://github.com/g41797/matryoshka-3tk/blob/main/design/3tk-patterns-002.md):
`027-poll.c3`, `028-receive_all.c3`, `029-out_of_band.c3`,  
`030-close_recovery.c3`, `031-release_a_refused_transfer.c3`,  
`032-wake_without_a_message.c3`. Every entry in this section has a code  
shape, so all six got a file.

**One defect caught while drafting, before `run-builds.sh` ever ran**: entry  
31's first draft closed and released the mailbox, then called `send` on it —  
`release` frees the mailbox and its mutex (`mailbox.c3:112`), so the send  
would have been a use-after-free. The example now closes, attempts the send  
and releases only once the outcome is checked, matching the catalog's own  
point that a refused transfer still leaves the mailbox usable.

**One build error, caught by `run-builds.sh` and not by inspection.** Entry  
32's `Atomic{bool}` fields need `import std::atomic::types`, which every  
other `Atomic` use in `examples/` and `test/` gets for free by importing  
`mtk` first (its own sources pull the type in); this file imports nothing  
that does, so the import had to be written explicitly.

**Entry 32 is the section's only one with a real second thread.** It follows  
`t_concurrency.c3`'s `Thread`/`thread::sleep` shape: a receiver blocks on  
`receive` with a 2s timeout, the main thread flips a flag and calls  
`wake_all`, and the receiver's `WOKEN` branch reads the flag rather than  
looping forever, so a failed wake fails the test by timeout instead of  
hanging the suite.

`run-builds.sh` is green — 87 checks, four builds, 120 tests each (up from  
114, the six new wrappers). `check-doc-loop.sh` not re-run: `src/` did not  
change. **Not yet copied to `matryoshka-3tk` or pushed** — that is the  
owner's step.

## 2026-08-31 — 3TK-50 step 4: catalog section "The infrastructure is an outer too"

**Four files, entries 23 through 26** of
[3tk-patterns-002.md](https://github.com/g41797/matryoshka-3tk/blob/main/design/3tk-patterns-002.md):
`023-infrastructure_wrapper.c3`, `024-mailbox_as_message.c3`,  
`025-worker_finish_signal.c3`, `026-pool_as_message.c3`. All four entries in  
this section have a code shape, unlike the last two sections, so every one got  
a file.

**One build error, caught by `run-builds.sh` and not by inspection.** Entry  
26's hooks struct, written with no fields as the catalog shows no hooks logic,  
hit c3c's *"Zero sized structs are not permitted."* `NoopHooks` was given one  
unused `bool` field to satisfy the compiler; the catalog's own code shape does  
not show this because it never declares the struct body.

**Entry 25's instance check is a real pointer comparison**, `got != worker_mbx`  
against two live `Mailbox*`, matching the catalog's own note that a  
handle-only API would have compared two look-alike handles instead. Entry 24  
sends a mailbox that is still open on the far side of the crossing, and the  
test asserts `!got.is_closed()` to say so.

`run-builds.sh` is green after the fix — 87 checks, four builds, 114 tests  
each (up from 110, the four new wrappers). `check-doc-loop.sh` not re-run:  
`src/` did not change. **Not yet copied to `matryoshka-3tk` or pushed** —  
that is the owner's step.

## 2026-08-31 — 3TK-50 step 3: catalog section "Dispatch"

**Four files, entries 17 through 20** of
[3tk-patterns-002.md](https://github.com/g41797/matryoshka-3tk/blob/main/design/3tk-patterns-002.md):
`017-dispatch_outer_first.c3`, `018-dispatch_identity_first.c3`,  
`019-dispatch_switch.c3`, `020-dispatch_table.c3`. **Entries 21 and 22 have no  
code shape** — 21 is the last-branch rule and 22 is a diagram — so neither has  
a file.

**One build error, caught by `run-builds.sh` and not by inspection.** The  
catalog's entry 18 code shape still declares `on_close(&self, InnerQueue*  
remaining)`, the pointer signature from before 3TK-56 rewrote the hook to take  
the queue by value. The fast `-O3` build failed with *"The prototype argument  
has type 'InnerQueue', but in this function it has type 'InnerQueue\*'"*  
against `src/pool.c3:101`'s `fn void on_close(InnerQueue remaining);`.  
`018-dispatch_identity_first.c3`'s `CreateByIdentityHooks.on_close` was  
corrected to `InnerQueue remaining`, by value — the catalog itself is stale on  
this one line and is not fixed here, since it is `matryoshka-3tk`'s file and  
this stage only writes `examples/`.

**Entry 17's `free_outer` is reused by entry 18's `on_close`**, imported as  
`exm::dispatch_outer_first::free_outer` — the same reuse the catalog's own  
entry 44 describes for a pool's remainder.

`run-builds.sh` is green after the fix — 87 checks, four builds, 110 tests  
each (up from 106, the four new wrappers). `check-doc-loop.sh`, run with  
`REF=matryoshka-3tk/design/3tk-reference-005.md`, is unchanged: 456/457  
sentences, 0 banned words — `src/` did not change. **Not yet copied to  
`matryoshka-3tk` or pushed** — that is the owner's step.

## 2026-08-31 — `preview-docs.sh` was missing `examples/`

**Found after step 2**: the preview only ever docgenned `$ROOT/src`, so none of  
the fifteen `exm::*` modules under `3tk/examples/` — added by 3TK-50 steps 1  
and 2 — showed up in the page a reader previews. `c3c docgen` takes more than  
one path, so the fix is one word: `--emit-stdlib=no "$ROOT/src"  
"$ROOT/examples"`. Verified by running docgen with both paths and grepping the  
generated `docs.html` for `exm::` — all fifteen modules and their functions are  
now in it, and the page is still self-contained (one `EMBEDDED_JSON_LIST.push`,  
no external fetch). No stage number — a tooling fix, not a stage.

## 2026-08-31 — 3TK-50 step 2: catalog section "Crossing the border"

**Five files, entries 11, 12, 13, 15 and 16** of
[3tk-patterns-002.md](https://github.com/g41797/matryoshka-3tk/blob/main/design/3tk-patterns-002.md):
`011-embedding_the_inner.c3`, `012-type_crossing.c3`,  
`013-recovering_the_type.c3`, `015-walk_a_batch.c3`,  
`016-reach_into_a_full_slot.c3`. **Entry 14, "Stack outers are illegal", has no  
code shape** — the catalog says so directly — so it has no file; only its  
prohibition is why the other four entries in this section all heap-allocate.

**Two build errors, both caught by `run-builds.sh` and neither by inspection.**  
`if (!catch expr) ...` is not a legal standalone use of `catch` in c3c 0.8.3 —  
`catch` binds a value inside an `if`/`while` condition or a `defer`, never  
bare. The wrapper for entry 16 rewrote it as `if (catch f = mb.receive(...))  
return;` followed by the release on the next line. And `foreach (i :  
usz[3])` does not enumerate — `usz[3]` names a type, not a value — so entry  
15's batch-of-three send loop is an ordinary `for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)`.

**`test/t_examples.c3`'s wrapper for entry 16 needed its own `Mailbox`**,  
created and closed in the `@test` itself, since the example takes one as a  
parameter rather than creating its own — the only wrapper in this stage that  
does more than call the entry point and check the fault, and it does no more  
than the mailbox lifecycle the example's own signature requires.

**`run-builds.sh` is green — 87 checks, four builds, 106 tests each** (up from  
101). **`check-doc-loop.sh`, run with `REF` pointed at  
`matryoshka-3tk`'s `3tk-reference-005.md`** (the in-repo default is stale,  
noted in step 1 and unchanged here): 456/457 sentences found, the same one  
pre-existing miss, 0 banned words. **Banned-word scan of the five new files and  
the rewritten wrapper: 0 hits of `item`/`items`.** `3tk/src` is unchanged: 125  
hits, same as step 1's baseline. **Not yet copied to `matryoshka-3tk` or  
pushed** — the owner's step.

## 2026-08-31 — 3TK-50 step 1: `examples/` exists, catalog section "Slot and transfer idioms"

**The examples tree is created.** `3tk/examples/outers.c3` (`exm::outers`:  
`Event`, `Sensor`, `Holder`, matching the catalog's shared outers) and  
`3tk/examples/helpers.c3` (`exm::helpers::expect`, the one check an example  
makes) are the shared infrastructure every later step reuses.

**Nine pattern files, one per catalog entry with a code shape**, entries 1 and  
3 through 10 of
[3tk-patterns-002.md](https://github.com/g41797/matryoshka-3tk/blob/main/design/3tk-patterns-002.md):
`001-empty_slot.c3`, `003-transfer_empties_slot.c3`, `004-insert_from_slot.c3`,  
`005-null_safe_cleanup.c3`, `006-defer_put_early.c3`,  
`007-defer_release_early.c3`, `008-defer_for_received_outer.c3`,  
`009-refused_put_fallback.c3`, `010-no_raw_allocator_call.c3`. **Entry 2 has no  
code shape** — the catalog says so directly, "nowhere" — so it has no file.

**One file name was shortened against the rule's own numbering scheme.**  
`009-fallback_release_after_refused_put.c3` does not compile: c3c 0.8.3 caps a  
module name at 31 characters and `exm::fallback_release_after_refused_put` is
34. Renamed to `009-refused_put_fallback.c3`, module `exm::refused_put_fallback`.
Not in the rules or the catalog — a c3c capability neither document measured  
for a name this long.

**`test/t_examples.c3` is the wrapper.** One `@test` per example, each reading  
the returned fault with `if (catch f = ...)` and reporting through  
`always_assert` — the only file in this step where `always_assert` appears.  
`project.json`'s `test-sources` gained `"examples"` alongside `"test"`, so  
`c3c test` compiles and runs both trees as one binary.

**One leak, found by `c3c test`'s own detector, not by inspection.** Entry 3's  
example closed the mailbox in its top-level `defer` but discarded the queue  
`close` gave back, losing the one outer the example had sent — entry 30's own  
rule, "do not discard the queue," violated by the entry demonstrating transfer.  
Fixed by walking and releasing it, the same shape entry 30 gives.

**`run-builds.sh`: 87 checks, 0 failures, four builds green, 101 tests in  
each** (92 before this step, +9 for the wrappers). **`check-doc-loop.sh`**,  
pointed at `3tk-reference-005.md` in `matryoshka-3tk` since the in-repo default  
path is stale: unchanged at 457 sentences, 456 found, the one pre-existing  
`inner.c3` gap, 0 banned words — `src/` was not touched. **A live banned-word  
scan over every file this step wrote**: 0 hits.

**Not yet copied to `matryoshka-3tk` or pushed.** That is the owner's step, per
[3tk-example-rules-002.md](https://github.com/g41797/matryoshka-3tk/blob/main/design/3tk-example-rules-002.md)'s
closing section.

## 2026-08-31 — Stage A: stack outers ruled illegal, docs revised and republished to `matryoshka-3tk`

**The owner reviewed [3tk-patterns-001.md](backup/3tk-patterns-001.md) ahead of  
running 3TK-50** and found entry 14, "A stack outer into the toolkit," unsafe:  
it pushed a stack-allocated outer onto a queue and sent one through a mailbox.

**Why it is a real defect, not a style preference.** 3tk computes an outer's  
address from its embedded `Inner` at every crossing — a `fieldParentPtr`-style  
offset from a fixed field. That address has to stay valid for as long as any  
`Handle`, queue entry, or mailbox reference to the outer can still be reached.  
A stack struct's address is valid for exactly one lexical instance of one  
frame: a copy of the struct, or a use after the frame returns, reaches through  
a stale address. It can appear to work and fail later, unpredictably.

**The ruling: a stack outer is illegal, everywhere, not only across a mailbox  
or thread boundary.** This does not make `mtk::managed` the only legal path to  
a heap outer — a raw heap allocation plus `mtk::helper::init` stays legal for  
an outer with no `Allocator` field — it makes the stack illegal as a place to  
put one at all.

**Three documents were swept for the pattern and one occurrence each was  
found and fixed**, all three of them the same "define, then push onto a  
queue or send" walkthrough:

- [3tk-patterns-001.md](backup/3tk-patterns-001.md) entry 14 — rewritten as
  the prohibition itself, with no code shape, in
  [3tk-patterns-002.md](https://github.com/g41797/matryoshka-3tk/blob/main/design/3tk-patterns-002.md).
- [3tk-example-rules-001.md](backup/3tk-example-rules-001.md)'s Allocation
  section — gained an explicit MUST, in
  [3tk-example-rules-002.md](https://github.com/g41797/matryoshka-3tk/blob/main/design/3tk-example-rules-002.md).
- [3tk-reference-004.md](backup/3tk-reference-004.md) Part 1's *Usual flow*
  walkthrough — the demo outer moved to the heap, via `mtk::managed`, in
  [3tk-reference-005.md](https://github.com/g41797/matryoshka-3tk/blob/main/design/3tk-reference-005.md).

**A second, separate local repo, `matryoshka-3tk`, is now where these three  
documents live.** The owner is standing it up to run light builds and  
doc-site preview, and to receive copies of files verified in this repo after  
each step. `matryoshka-3tk/design/` is the target — the owner is asked exactly  
where before any new file is created there, every time.

**In this repo:** the three old versions, and the superseded  
`ref/3tk-doc-loop-003.md` (repointed to `3tk-reference-005.md`, republished as  
`ref/3tk-doc-loop-004.md`), moved to `backup/`. Every live cross-reference in  
`3tk-status.md` now points at the new location. Historical narrative in  
finished, closed documents — `3tk-on-close-handoff-001.md`,  
`3tk-on-close-policy-001.md`, `3tk-open-defects.md`'s closed `P6` section, the  
published `3tk-staging-plan-020.md` — was left as it stood: each correctly  
names the version that was live when it was written, the same principle that  
exempts `STATUS-LOG.md` entries from a bulk repoint.

**Not resolved, and not this stage's to resolve:** `backup/README.md` still  
names the old three files and sits under `backup/` while other documents link  
to it at root — the same *archived or displaced* question `3tk-status.md`  
already has open, now with one more reason to answer it.

**Post-stage cleanup.** None — this stage wrote no `3tk/src`, no test, no  
example. `3tk-status.md`'s *What is live now*, *stages that have not run*,  
*where things live* and *how to start after a clear* sections were updated  
to match.

**3TK-50 starts from the corrected documents**, in steps grouped by the  
pattern catalog's own sections. No step has run yet.

## 2026-08-30 — 3TK-56: the close hook takes the queue by value, in code

**Built [3tk-on-close-handoff-001.md](3tk-on-close-handoff-001.md), the  
2026-08-28 ruling.** `P6` closes: `on_close` receives `InnerQueue`, not  
`InnerQueue*`, and the pool holds nothing back.

**`InnerQueue.take()`** — `3tk/src/queue.c3` — hands over everything the queue  
holds and empties the source, O(1), cannot fail. Both call sites in  
`pool.c3` — the straggler path (`:494`) and the main close (`:564`) — became  
`self._hooks.on_close(stragglers.take())` and  
`self._hooks.on_close(remaining.take())`.

**The six implementers followed**: `negative/common.c3`,  
`negative/release_with_straggler_put.c3`, `negative/release_during_on_put.c3`,  
`negative/release_during_on_close.c3`, `test/t_concurrency.c3` (two hooks),  
`test/t_pool.c3`. Only the signature line changed in every one — a by-value  
struct parameter is an lvalue, so `&self` methods (`pop_front`, `is_empty`,  
`len`) bind to it exactly as they did through the pointer, and no body needed  
touching. The three `release_during_*` tier 1 negatives still abort in every  
build mode, unweakened.

**One positive test, no negative.** `t_queue.c3:take_empties_the_source`  
proves the source is empty after `take()`. No negative is possible: a hook  
that keeps items dereferences nothing, so no build could ever notice a leak  
however the parameter is spelled — that is the ruling working as intended, not  
a gap in coverage.

**Wording, not just code.** `PoolHooks.on_close`'s doc block in `pool.c3` now  
carries *the pool does not verify it and never will*, and the same sentence  
went to `ref/3tk-reference-004.md` — named directly by the charter, and edited  
in place rather than versioned. `ref/3tk-decisions-004.md` gained the `P6`  
entry under `pool.c3` and a `take()` entry under `queue.c3`; `-003` moved to  
`backup/`. `3tk-port-findings-004.md` gained §4a, the argument for dtk and otk  
to read: no shared-specification change, because Part 12.2 already says the  
hook is handed the items and not through what; ztk's `on_close` was read at  
`pool.zig:127-130` and is still by pointer, an open divergence and not a  
recommendation. `-003` moved to `backup/`. `3tk-open-defects.md`'s `P6` row and  
section are marked ruled and built.

**Verified**: `run-builds.sh` four builds green, 87 checks, 92 tests per build  
(the new `take()` test), 0 failures. `check-doc-loop.sh` 0 differing blocks,  
457 sentences, 456 found — the one miss is the pre-existing `inner.c3` module  
summary — 0 banned words. `run-sanitizers.sh` 3 passed, 0 failed, the hook path  
exercised on every run.

**`grep -roiwE 'items?'` moved 365 to 366 in `ref`**, from `take()`'s two new  
sentences in the decisions entry; `3tk/src` is unchanged at 125, because  
`take()`'s doc block never says *item*.

**3TK-50 is the only stage left** — the examples tree, independent of the fix.

## 2026-08-28 — the owner rules `P6`: the close hook takes the queue by value

**A ruling, not a stage. No code changed.** Recorded here because the ruling and  
the stage that builds it are separated by a context clear.

> **`on_close` takes the queue by value.** That says to the hook: **I do not
> care what you did.** Comments and documentation say the same thing in words.

**`P6` is answered as option 3** — trust the hook, write it down — **and the  
by-value signature is a stronger spelling of it than the option as written**: the  
pool physically cannot observe what the hook did, so the interface is honest by  
construction rather than by promise. **Options 1 and 2 are closed for good.**

**Measured before advising**, c3c 0.8.3: a by-value struct parameter is an  
lvalue, so `&self` methods bind to it and the hook's ergonomics are unchanged —  
and the caller's copy is untouched, which is both the point of the ruling and  
the reason the copy must become a real move rather than a shallow alias.

**The advice was 2 + 3 and it lost.** A leak dereferences nothing, so no build  
can notice it however the parameter is spelled, and the checked-build assertion  
was the only detector this defect could ever have. **The owner ruled that an  
interface which says *I do not care* is better than a pointer that suggests  
otherwise.** The trade is written into
[3tk-on-close-handoff-001.md](3tk-on-close-handoff-001.md) section 6 so it is
visible and not reopened.

**Five defaults went with it, all accepted**: the operation is `InnerQueue.take()`;  
`InnerStack` gets none; `_close` keeps its out-parameter; no specification  
version, but the argument is recorded for dtk; `on_put`'s `extra` stays a  
pointer because it is a genuine out-parameter.

**Written: [3tk-on-close-handoff-001.md](3tk-on-close-handoff-001.md)** — the  
ruling, the defaults, the work list, the 19 call sites across 6 files, and what  
must still abort. **It is 3TK-56's only input besides the status file.**

---

## 2026-08-28 — 3TK-52, closed and quiet, in the text that binds four ports

**The last piece of the lifetime fix, and the only one that was never 3tk's  
alone.** The C3 port had been enforcing *closed and quiet* since 3TK-53 and  
3TK-54 while
[../common/matryoshka-specification-004.md](../common/backup/matryoshka-specification-004.md)
still said *closed* and nothing more. **A port stricter than the specification is  
the specification being behind**, not a deviation, and the fix for that is to  
move the text.

**The owner ruled `Q-D` on 2026-08-28, both halves.**

> **`Q-D.1`: yes** — the shared specification states closed *and quiet* before
> released.
>
> **`Q-D.2`: port-first, ratified** — a port may run ahead of the shared
> document as long as it writes down which way it assumed the question would go.

**Written:
[../common/matryoshka-specification-005.md](../common/matryoshka-specification-005.md).**
`004` went to `common/backup/`.

**Part 11.12 is now *Closed and quiet before release*.** Four words are named  
where all four ports can reach them — **open, closed, quiet, freed** — and the  
distinction that was missing is stated plainly: close ends no call that is  
already running, so a closed container with a waiting receive, or a put inside  
its hook, may not be released either.

**The obligation is split, and that split is the whole reason this could be  
written without breaking a finished port.** Every port **states** the  
precondition; a port **checks** it where a check is cheap, and says so when it  
does not. **It is a check and never a wait** — a release that waited would block  
on application code, which Part 12.3 already forbids holding a mutex across.

**Why the split was necessary.** `src/mailbox.zig` has a closed flag and no  
count of calls in flight. A flat *MUST detect it* would have made ztk — green,  
195/195, closed 2026-08-14 — retroactively non-conforming for a behaviour it was  
never asked for. **Stating costs ztk one sentence of documentation and no code**,  
and gives dtk the rule at its founding. That sentence is ztk's line of work to  
write, and it is recorded as such in the status file; **3tk does not edit another  
port's documents.**

**Three citing sites moved with it.** Part 15.5's contract-violation example and  
its *never compiles out* sentence, and Part 18's invariant row 26. **No Part was  
renumbered and no conformance marking changed** — assumption A1 still holds, and  
005 widens what 11.12 covers rather than how hard it bites.

**The change log carries the reader-of-004 section**, as every version does, plus  
a *What 005 was written on* section recording the port-first ruling — because it  
governs more than one version, and dtk is the boundary: **the shared text is  
current before dtk's first stage**, the same deadline the `Item`/`Outer` wording  
already has.

**Filing, and the convention it follows.** Live documents were re-pointed to  
`005`: `common/README.md`, `../d/dtk-status.md`, `../d/inputs/README.md`,  
`ref/3tk-example-rules-001.md` and this line's status file. **Frozen stage  
outputs keep the version they were written against** — the same treatment 003 and  
004 got, and the reason nothing in `backup/` was touched. **`kitchen/tools/check_design.sh`  
still reports 14 dead links**, the number that would signal a regression, so the  
move added none.

**One measured row was re-taken while its file was open.**  
`ref/3tk-example-rules-001.md` counts the word *item* per tree, and three of its  
four rows were stale: `3tk/src` 124 to 125, `3tk/test` and `3tk/negative` 203 to  
219, `ref/` 360 to 365, and the specification row 164 to 165 against `005`. **The  
row's own rule is unchanged** — it is the live number, not a target.

**No code was touched and no script was run beyond the link checker**, because  
nothing under `3tk/` changed. The numbers 3TK-55 measured still stand.

**Advice: clear the context.** 3TK-50 is the only stage left, it is independent  
of all of this, and it starts cold from the status file.

---

## 2026-08-28 — 3TK-55, the defect list catches up with the code

**No code changed in this stage, and that is what it is for.** 3TK-53 and 3TK-54  
built the lifetime fix in the two tools on 2026-08-28. **The list that named the  
defect still said it was open**, and every line number and every measured number  
in it was anchored to a tree that no longer exists. This stage closed the row and  
re-printed the numbers.

**`Q5` is fixed.** The row in [3tk-open-defects.md](3tk-open-defects.md) now says  
so: mailbox 3TK-53, pool 3TK-54, both 2026-08-28, closed by 3TK-55 the same day.  
Seven of the ten items are done, one is open, two were closed without a fix.  
**`P6` is the only thing left on that list**, and it is the owner's.

**The three scripts were re-run before anything was written**, because a number  
counts only when it has just been measured:

```
./run-builds.sh        87 checks, 0 failures, four builds green, 91 tests per build
./check-doc-loop.sh    0 differing blocks, 452 sentences, 451 found, 1 missing
                       0 banned words
./run-sanitizers.sh    3 passed, 0 failed — thread on two builds, address on one
grep -roiwE 'items?'   125 in 3tk/src, 365 in ref
```

**The one missing descriptor sentence is the pre-existing `inner.c3` module  
summary** and is not new. **`3tk/src`'s *item* count went 124 to 125**, which is  
the lifetime fix's new prose and nothing else; `ref` has not moved since  
2026-08-27.

**`run-sanitizers.sh` was added to the list the defect file tells the next  
session to re-measure.** The fix is a concurrency change and four green builds do  
not speak for it. The file also now records that **a skip is not a pass** — the  
script exits 2 when its compiler is missing.

**Every line number in the file was re-printed live.** `Q5`'s two assertions are  
at `mailbox.c3:124` and `pool.c3:253`; `P6`'s three sites moved from `434`, `492`  
and `458-460` to `493`, `563` and `526-527`, because the lifetime fix grew  
`Pool.release` above them. **`grep -n 2DO src/*.c3` now returns nothing** — 3TK-53  
took the mailbox's comment, 3TK-54 the pool's.

**And one dependency turned out to be discharged rather than met.** The file said  
`P6`'s option 1 — count what was handed over, count what came back — needed  
`Q5`'s stage first, because a count means nothing until no further `on_close` can  
arrive, and it expected `Q5` to supply that end point by *waiting* for zero.  
**The ruling of 2026-08-28 does not wait; it asserts.** The end point exists all  
the same — a `release` that returns has proved the count was zero — but it is  
proved rather than waited for. **So all three of `P6`'s options are available and  
it is a free ruling**, which the file now says in both places it discussed the  
order.

**What was deliberately not touched.** `Part 11.12` of
[../common/matryoshka-specification-004.md](../common/matryoshka-specification-004.md)
is 3TK-52's, binds four ports and needs `Q-D`. It is the only part of the  
lifetime fix still unwritten, and closing `Q5`'s row does not close it.

**Advice: clear the context.** Nothing here is needed by 3TK-52 or 3TK-50, and  
both start cold from the status file.

---

## 2026-08-28 — 3TK-54, the pool learns what quiet means, and pays for it once

**The other half of the lifetime fix, and the harder half.** 3TK-53 did the  
mailbox, which has no hook; this one did the pool, where `Part 12.3` forces the  
mutex OPEN across every call into application code. **Taking the mutex proves  
nothing there, and that is the whole reason the count exists.**

**What went in.** A `usz _active` in `Pool`, under the mutex the tool already  
owns, exactly as the mailbox has it. Every accepted call raises it after the  
closed check and lowers it under the mutex before returning: `get`, `get_wait`,  
`put`, `close` and `count_of`. A rejected entry raises nothing. `release` is  
never counted.

**Three sites the mailbox does not have, and each one is a separate negative.**

- **`put` inside `on_put`.** The count is raised before the unlock at `:421`
  and lowered only after the re-take at `:423` — the re-take is the line that  
  touches a mutex a release breaking Rule 1 has already destroyed.
- **`close` inside its own `on_close`.** `Pool.close` publishes CLOSED, opens
  the mutex and runs application code. It stays counted through the hook, which  
  costs it one re-take it did not have.
- **the straggler `on_close`, called from inside `put`.** A count that stopped
  at `on_put` would read zero while that second hook ran. It is lowered after  
  the hook, on that path too.

**`get_wait` needed one duplicated check rather than one moved one.** Its closed  
test lives at the head of the wait loop, where a woken waiter reads it. The  
entry test is a different question — *was this call accepted at all* — so the  
stage added one before the raise and left the loop's alone. Moving it would have  
changed which of `UNKNOWN_IDENTITY` and `CLOSED` a closed pool reports, and  
*What stays unchanged* forbids that.

**A private `_close` now holds the state change**, as in the mailbox: the  
`_closed` write, the RELEASE store, the drain of every bucket into the caller's  
queue, the broadcast. **And `release` does not call it**, for the reason 3TK-53  
found on its side and this stage confirmed on the pool's: a `release` that  
closed first would pass its own check and `negative/release_open_pool.c3` would  
stop aborting. **The check comes first and nothing else runs when it fails.**

**The added lock in `Pool.get`, measured rather than assumed.** The design named  
one added acquisition and asked for its cost. Single thread, uncontended,  
`--safe=yes -O3`, 20 million iterations, three runs each, against a copy of the  
pre-change source:

```
hook path    (get NEW_ONLY, on_get fills)    18.9 -> 31.6 ns   +12.7 ns
stored path  (get AVAILABLE_ONLY + put)      60.9 -> 61.5 ns   within noise
```

**Only the hook path pays it**, because only the hook path leaves the mutex; the  
three modes that return under the first acquisition pay the increment and the  
decrement and nothing else. **And the +12.7 ns is measured against a hook that  
does one pointer store.** A real `on_get` allocates, so the acquisition is a  
fraction of a percent of what the caller is already spending to get there — the  
worst case is the one measured, and it is the case that does not happen.

**Four negatives, all tier 1, all deterministic.** `release_not_quiet_pool` is  
the pool's counterpart to `release_while_receiving`: a `get_wait` woken by the  
close and not yet returned. The other three park a hook until the main thread  
has published that it is about to release, so each window is entered on purpose  
rather than raced for — `release_during_on_put`, `release_during_on_close`, and  
`release_with_straggler_put`, which waits for the *second* `on_close` before it  
releases. All four abort in all four builds with the new message.

**Two tests.** `the_pool_closed_then_quiet_then_freed` walks CLOSED, then QUIET,  
then FREED with an assertion at each step, and reads `p._active` directly the  
way the mailbox's test reads `mb._active`. `the_pool_close_then_join_then_  
release` runs the ordinary shape: three workers borrowing and returning, joined  
first, then close, then release. The pool's close gives nothing back, so unlike  
the mailbox's shape there is no queue to drain — **what the caller owes is the  
join, and that is the whole point.**

**What the reference gained.** The pool's `release` and `close` descriptors, the  
module block, Part 5's *Usual flow* step 6, the four new programs under *Where  
to go deeper* — and one addition to Part 6 that is not a copy of the mailbox's:  
**the pool has a second way to be closed and not quiet**, and a reader who knows  
only the parked-receiver case would not predict it. A pool can be closed, hold  
nothing, refuse every new call, and still have application code inside it.

**`Part 11.12` was left alone again**, for the reason 3TK-53 left it alone: it  
lives in the shared specification, it binds four ports, and it is 3TK-52's,  
which needs `Q-D`. The rule went into 3tk's own reference and its descriptors.

**Verified live, 2026-08-28, at the end of the stage:**

```
./run-builds.sh        87 checks, 0 failures, four builds green, 91 tests each
./check-doc-loop.sh    0 differing blocks, 452 sentences, 451 found
                       1 missing — the pre-existing inner.c3 module summary
                       0 banned words
./run-sanitizers.sh    thread on two builds, address on one, all clean
```

71 checks became 87 — four tier 1 rows in each of the four builds. 89 tests  
became 91. The doc loop moved 446 to 452 because the pool's descriptors took on  
the rule.

**Advice: clear the context.** The lifetime fix is now built on both tools, and  
what is left of it is bookkeeping — `3TK-55` re-measures and closes `Q5`, and  
`3TK-52` needs an owner answer before it can run. Neither reads anything this  
stage held in working memory.

## 2026-08-28 — 3TK-53, the mailbox learns what quiet means

**The first stage to touch `3tk/src` since the lifetime work began.** Five  
stages wrote [3tk-lifetime-fix-005.md](3tk-lifetime-fix-005.md) without changing  
a byte of the port; this one built the mailbox half of what it specifies.

**What went in.** A `usz _active` in `Mailbox`, under the mutex the tool already  
owns — no atomic, because the mutex already protects `_closed` and the queues  
and a second synchronization domain buys nothing. Every accepted call raises it  
after the closed check and lowers it before returning: `send_at`, `poll`,  
`receive`, `receive_all`, `wake_all`, `len` and `close`. A rejected entry never  
raises. `release` is never counted, because it would then assert against itself.

**The assertion is rewritten, not removed.** `always_assert(self._closed)` became  
`always_assert(self._closed && self._active == 0, "releasing a mailbox that is  
not quiet")`, read under the mutex and never before taking it. The `2DO` block  
that stood at `mailbox.c3:108-112` is gone, and with it the pointer to  
`3tk-release-while-busy-001.md`, whose conclusion the 2026-08-28 ruling replaced.

**A private `_close` now holds the state change** — the `_closed` write, the  
RELEASE store to the fast-path flag, the transfer into the caller's queue, the  
broadcast. `close` takes the mutex, raises the count and calls it.

**Two things the stage had to rule, because two inputs disagreed.**

**First: `release` does not call `_close`.** Section 2 of the fix document says  
*release invokes `_close` if the tool is still open*, and section 13 says  
`negative/release_open_mailbox.c3` must still abort. **Both cannot hold** — a  
`release` that closes first would find `_closed` true and pass its own check, and  
the tier 1 program would stop aborting. The status file settles it in the port's  
favour: *no signature changes*, and `Mailbox.release` has no `out` queue to close  
into. **So the check comes first and nothing else runs when it fails**, and  
`_close` has one caller in the mailbox rather than two. 3TK-54 will find the same  
thing in the pool.

**Second: `Part 11.12` is not this stage's to write.** The status row for 3TK-53  
says *the rule text into `Part 11.12` and the descriptors*, and Part 11.12 lives  
in [../common/matryoshka-specification-004.md](../common/matryoshka-specification-004.md),  
which is **3TK-52's**, and 3TK-52 is blocked on `Q-D`. **So this stage wrote the  
rule into 3tk's own reference and its descriptors, and left the shared clause  
alone.** The code keeps its `[3tk: Part 11.12]` tags. This is what kept 3TK-53  
runnable without an owner answer, which is why it was picked.

**The destruction order was established against the real structs**, as section 7  
asks, and it is not the sketch. C3's `Mutex.destroy` is `pthread_mutex_destroy`,  
which **aborts** on the `EBUSY` a held mutex returns — so `release` takes the  
mutex, checks, releases it, and only then destroys the condition variable and  
the mutex. The comment at the site says so; nothing was changed on the strength  
of the document's block.

**What the reference gained.** The `release` and `close` descriptors, the module  
block, *Usual flow* step 5, and a new Part 6 subsection — *Closed is not quiet* —  
carrying `OPEN -> CLOSED -> QUIET -> FREED`, why the toolkit checks instead of  
waiting, the three-line shape a caller writes, and the two things the check does  
**not** do: it catches a violation only on the schedule it sees, and it says  
nothing about a thread that merely holds the pointer.

**One program and two tests.**  
`negative/release_while_receiving.c3` is tier 1 and deterministic — a receiver  
publishes that it is about to park, the main thread waits, closes, and releases  
without joining. It aborts in all four builds with the new message, verified in  
`--safe=no -O3` by hand as well as by the script. `run-builds.sh` gained it as a  
tier 1 row, with a comment saying why Part 11.12 has two halves and the suite  
had been testing one.  
`closed_then_quiet_then_freed` walks CLOSED, then QUIET, then FREED with an  
assertion at each step; `close_then_join_then_release` runs the ordinary shape.  
Both read `mb._active` directly, the way `t_concurrency.c3` reads `mb._cv` — a  
deliberate use of what D1 leaves reachable, because there is no public way to  
ask whether a tool is quiet and there must not be one.

**Two compile failures, both the same missing `import std::atomic::types`,** and  
`run-builds.sh` caught the second one properly: it judges compile and run  
separately, so the new tier 1 program was reported as *does not compile* rather  
than passing as *aborted*. That separation was added after `release_open_pool`  
went unexercised for exactly this reason, and it earned itself again.

**Verified live, 2026-08-28, at the end of the stage:**

```
./run-builds.sh        71 checks, 0 failures, four builds green, 89 tests each
./check-doc-loop.sh    0 differing blocks, 446 sentences, 445 found
                       1 missing — the pre-existing inner.c3 module summary
                       0 banned words
./run-sanitizers.sh    thread on two builds, address on one, all clean
```

67 checks became 71 — one tier 1 row in each of the four builds. 87 tests became
89. The doc loop moved 440 to 446 because the descriptors took on the rule.

**Advice: clear the context.** 3TK-54 is the same mechanism on the pool, and it  
starts cold from the status file and `3tk-lifetime-fix-005.md`. Nothing in this  
stage's working state is worth carrying into it; what 3TK-54 needs to know about  
the two contradictions is in this entry and in the status.

---

## 2026-08-28 — INTR 8, the status file compacted, and the rule that keeps it short

**[3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md) went from 2,358 lines and 137 KB to 301 lines  
and 16 KB.** The owner's instruction: the status is read at the start of every  
stage and written at the end of one, so its size is a running cost, and it had  
become a second log.

**The rule is now the first thing in the file**, above everything else:

> **Status holds what has not happened, what is true now, and how to start.
> The log holds what happened, when, and why.**

With four clauses under it: a stage appends one log entry and touches status only  
where its state changed; a sentence that explains a decision is log, and a  
sentence that tells the next session what to do is status; **a finished stage  
keeps a row and never a section**; and nothing is duplicated between the two.

**What the file had become.** `## Stages` alone was 1,064 lines — 45% of the  
file — a section per stage recording what each one found, argued and measured.  
`Resuming after an interruption`, `How to continue after a clear` and the stage  
list added on 2026-08-28 were three overlapping answers to one question, 540  
lines between them. `Files` was a 235-line folder listing that goes stale on its  
own. `Current state` was 89 lines describing 59 checks and 85 tests, from the  
3TK-9 era.

**Nothing was dropped without checking.** Every stage id in `## Stages` was  
compared against the log: **fifty of fifty already had an entry**, so the section  
was deleted whole rather than merged. Inbound links were checked too — **nothing  
links into the status at section level**, so no anchor broke.

**One thing was over-compacted and put back the same stage.** The first pass also  
removed *Standing facts* and *Open questions*, on the reading that they were  
history. **They are not** — the two open port defects `P3` and `P4`, the  
`Item`/`Outer` debt with its deadline at dtk's first stage, the ztk/3tk `on_get`  
difference, the `Slot` question, and the toolchain facts are all *what is true  
now* and *what has not happened*, which is exactly what the rule says the status  
is for. **Both sections are back, one line per item**, with the reasoning left in  
the document each one names. That is the distinction the rule turns on: the  
status says *that* a thing is open, the document says *why*.

**The file now holds**, in order: the rule; what is live; the five stages that  
have not run with the line that starts each; the open questions; the measured  
numbers; the rules that hold across every stage; where things live; how to start  
after a clear; **a one-line row for each of the fifty-two stages that have run**;  
and the seven interrupt stages in a table.

**One question is left standing in it for the owner**: twelve documents and  
`README.md` are in `backup/` while other files link to them at root — archived,  
or displaced?

**No source was touched**, and no other document changed. **Verified live:**  
`run-builds.sh` 67 checks, 87 tests in each of the four builds, all four green,  
0 failures. `check-doc-loop.sh` 0 differing blocks, 440 sentences, 439 found, the  
one pre-existing miss, 0 banned words. The ban scan over the rewritten status:  
**0 hits**. Every link in it printed and read — one dead link was found and  
repointed, `3tk-who-supports-slot.md`, which is in `backup/`.

## 2026-08-28 — INTR 7, the third review, and reviewing stops

**A third review read `-004`, endorsed the ruling, and said to proceed to 3TK-53  
and 3TK-54 rather than reopen the architecture.** Its verdict on the central  
decision: keep it. **`3tk-lifetime-fix-005.md` is its ten clarifications and  
nothing else** — no decision changed, no section moved, the shape INTR 6 built  
left alone. `-004` and the review are in `backup/`. **No byte of `3tk/src`,  
`test/` or `negative/` was touched.**

**Three of the ten earn their place on their own.**

**`close` lowers the count before it returns.** `-004` said *after its last  
access*, which is true and never says what a caller needs to hear: that  
`close(); release();` in one thread is the ordinary shape and works. Rule 1 is  
about the *other* threads. **This was the gap most likely to cost 3TK-53 a day.**

**QUIET is a predicate, not a field.** `_closed && _active == 0`, and `_quiet`  
must not become a third flag to keep consistent. Cheap to say, annoying to undo.

**A green negative proves that violation is caught, not that all are.** Seven  
deterministic programs read as proof of safety unless the document says  
otherwise beside the table. The assertion is a contract check and not a race  
detector.

**The rest are one-liners**, each traced in the change table: `_active == 0`  
means *no accepted operation is still inside*, not *nobody can touch this*; the  
three rules stated as three, with `_active` speaking only to the first; `_active`  
covering an operation's access including the hooks it invokes rather than the  
body of one function; the concurrency table made canonical — **`release` is  
concurrent with nothing, not even `close`**; a guard on the destruction sketch  
saying no source may be changed on its strength; `Pool.get`'s locking left as an  
invariant here and a sequence for 3TK-54, which reads the existing protocol  
first; and **a positive life-cycle test in `t_pool.c3`** asserting CLOSED, then  
QUIET, then FREED — the negatives prove only that closed is not quiet.

**Two of the ten corrected sentences INTR 6 wrote**, and both corrections are  
right. The missing decrement-before-return, above. And **the ruling does not ask  
*less* discipline than a waiting `release` — it asks *different* discipline.**  
The owner writes `close(); join(workers); release();` instead of  
`close(); release();`. The argument is not that there is less of it: it is that  
**the responsibility now sits where the tool's life is actually decided, instead  
of the port waiting on execution it does not control.** That is a stronger  
argument than the one it replaces, and it is the one to quote.

**Reviewing of this document stops here, and the document says so.** Three  
rounds — twenty points, thirty-three, ten — each smaller than the last, the third  
ending in *proceed*. **Further review goes into 3TK-53's own record, not into a  
sixth version of this file.** Rounds 1 and 2 both recommended the waiting design  
and neither was asked whether the port should absorb the hazard at all; round 3  
was asked, and agreed with the owner.

**Verified live, with no source changed:** `run-builds.sh` **67 checks, 87 tests  
in each of the four builds, all four green, 0 failures**. `check-doc-loop.sh`  
**0 differing blocks, 440 sentences, 439 found**, the one pre-existing `inner.c3`  
miss, **0 banned words**. The ban scan over the new file leaves **0 hits in  
prose**; those that remain are inside code blocks and are the same stdlib call  
name, which Part 5 exempts.

## 2026-08-28 — INTR 6, the ruling: state the rule, do not absorb it

**The owner ruled `Q5` on 2026-08-28**, and the ruling is the smallest change to  
the design that removes the most from it:

> **Release while a call is in flight is not prevented. It is written down as a
> thing the caller must not do, and it is checked. It is not waited for.**

**`3tk-lifetime-fix-004.md` is the document, and `-003` is in `backup/`.** No  
byte of `3tk/src`, `test/` or `negative/` was touched.

**What the owner saw that four documents and two reviews had not.** The two  
advice files both landed on a waiting `release`, both reviewers endorsed it, and  
`-001` to `-003` refined it. **None of them had been asked whether the port should  
absorb the hazard at all** — every one of them was reviewing a proposal that  
already assumed a mechanism. The owner's question was whether a documented rule  
would do, without adding code and therefore without adding bugs.

**It does, and the counter stays.** The split that decided it: **`_active` is  
nearly free — a `usz` under a mutex the call already holds. The wait is where  
every cost lived.** So the field stays and is maintained exactly as `-003`  
described it; `release` reads it once, in an `always_assert`, in all four builds.

**Three questions stopped arising, and one contradiction dissolved with them.**  
`Q-A` — nothing waits, so nothing can order one hook against another;  
`Part 12.2` and `Part 12.3` are untouched and
[3tk-on-close-policy-001.md](3tk-on-close-policy-001.md) is not reopened. `Q-B`
and `Q-C` — Rule 1 requires the tool closed before released, so `close(out)` and  
`on_close` have already given the items back and **neither `release` grows a  
parameter**. With no signature change, **the `Q5`-against-`Q-B` contradiction the  
second review called the largest problem in `-002` never arises**, and the `Q5`  
ruling's *the client's code is unaffected either way* stands as written. All four  
are recorded in section 15 with their reasons, so nobody reopens a question that  
no longer has content.

**`Q-E` and `Q-G` are answered too.** 3TK-50's examples carry no changed  
signature, so the two lines of work are independent. And `W3` — drafted as a  
temporary warning to be written in and out again within days — **is now permanent  
and is the fix.**

**Two questions stay open, and neither blocks the code.** `Q-D`, much smaller  
than it was: not *must every port implement a waiting release*, but **must every  
port state a precondition** — one word in `Part 11.12`, *closed and quiet before  
released*, with the joining sentence beside it. And `P6`, untouched.

**What the ruling costs, written in the document and not softened.** A check  
catches a violation on the schedule it happens on; a wait would have been correct  
on every schedule. **That is the whole price**, and the argument for paying it is  
that the port already lives on exactly this bargain — the stale pointer has  
always been a written rule, and Rule 1 does not remove a class of error but moves  
a line, from *do not release while anyone might be inside* to *do not release  
while anyone might enter*.

**What it no longer costs:** `release` still cannot block; no hook can hold a  
release for ever; **the deadlock clause INTR 5 had to add is gone with the wait**,  
and so is the predicate-loop rule and the `release_vs_close` oracle. The two  
`release_open_*` negatives stay tier 1 and nothing inverts. `run-builds.sh` gains  
rows and changes nothing else.

**The parked receiver is the case the rule is really about**, and it is written  
out: `close` wakes a thread inside `wait_until` but does not wait for it to  
leave. **Closed is not quiet.** A caller must close, observe the thread finish,  
and release after that — and both `close` descriptors now owe a sentence saying  
so, beside `Part 11.12` and the two `release` descriptors.

**Seven negatives, all ordinary tier-1 aborts in all four builds**, including a  
new `release_not_quiet_pool.c3` for a `get_wait` that has been woken but has not  
yet returned.

**The reorganization INTR 5 held back ran in this stage**, which is what it was  
waiting for: contract, mechanism, the two tools, consequences, programs, what is  
open, appendix. **The document is 834 lines against `-003`'s 1,301**, and nothing  
about the hazard was removed — the race, the hook window, the parked receiver and  
why taking the mutex proves nothing are all still described. A rule that is not  
explained is a rule somebody deletes later.

**One thing left standing for 3TK-53 unchanged by any of this:** the destruction  
ordering. `release` still destroys a mutex and a condition variable and frees the  
block holding them, and whether the mutex may be destroyed while held is still  
not known.

**Verified live, with no source changed:** `run-builds.sh` **67 checks, 87 tests  
in each of the four builds, all four green, 0 failures**. `check-doc-loop.sh`  
**0 differing blocks, 440 sentences, 439 found**, the one pre-existing `inner.c3`  
miss, **0 banned words**. The ban scan over the new file leaves **0 hits in  
prose**; those that remain are inside code blocks and are the same stdlib call  
name, which Part 5 exempts.

## 2026-08-28 — INTR 5, the second review absorbed

**`3tk-lifetime-fix-003.md` is written, and `-002` is in `backup/`.** The input  
was a **second review, of `-002`, thirty-three points** — the same reviewer, a  
second round, arriving hours after INTR 4 closed. **Both reviews are now in  
`backup/`**, the second as `3tk-bug-fixes-review-002.md`. **Twenty-eight points  
are acted on; five are deliberately not**, and the document says which and why.  
**No byte of `3tk/src`, `test/` or `negative/` was touched.**

**The finding that mattered most: `-002` was written against `Q-A` without  
saying so.** It declared the question open and then wrote sections 9, 11, 17, 18  
and 20 as though Variant 1 already held — the straggler `on_close` model only  
exists under Variant 1, and one of the negatives INTR 4 added depends on it.  
**The fix is not a ruling.** `-003` opens with a new **section 0, the working  
assumptions**: the three things assumed, the question each pre-empts, and what  
changes if the owner rules the other way. **Every dependent site now carries a  
`[Variant 1]` or `[Q-B]` tag**, so the version that carries the rulings deletes  
tags rather than hunting for assumptions. `Q-D` is split the same way — `Q-D.1`  
is whether the shared specification requires the waiting release, `Q-D.2` is  
whether every port owes it before claiming conformance.

**Three things were missing from the document altogether.**

**A hook must not wait on the release that is waiting for it.** Because `release`  
waits for application code, an application can build a cycle out of it and  
deadlock, and nothing inside the port can break one. `-002` said only that a slow  
`on_put` stalls every closer, which is the mild half. **It is now a clause in  
section 16**, and it belongs in whatever 3TK-52 writes.

**The release wait is a predicate loop, and a broadcast is only a wake-up.**  
`_close` broadcasts while the releasing thread still holds the mutex, and the  
same broadcast serves an ordinary waiter and the release waiting for quiet. A  
woken thread re-reads `_active` after the unlock. **That is the difference  
between a `while` and an `if` at the one site where an `if` would be a live bug.**

**The `release_vs_close_*` programs had no oracle.** INTR 4 added them and left  
them able to pass by luck. Either call may publish CLOSED first; the invariant is  
that **exactly one destroys and the other returns safely**, and that is what the  
two programs check.

**Four corrections where `-002` claimed more than it had.** The invariant said  
*every operation raises `_active`*, which its own rejected-entry path and its own  
definition of *active* both contradict — it is **every operation accepted after  
the closed check**. The probe section reported *release returned* when no release  
of this port had run; it now says the release-shaped sequence completed, and  
`WAIT_TIMEOUT` is narrowed to the four builds tested. `P6`'s *no further  
`on_close` can arrive* becomes *every operation accepted before the closure has  
finished*, because Race B says a stale caller may still exist. And *three of five  
are done* becomes **one done, one narrowed, three open** — a destruction ordering  
handed to 3TK-53 is scoped, not established.

**One argument was made on the owner's behalf and is withdrawn.** `-002` said an  
open mailbox *cannot be released safely* without a caller's `out`. Lifetime  
safety does not force that: discarding, or an internally named destination, also  
satisfy the invariant. **The requirement is to define what becomes of the items,  
not to pass a parameter.** The three designs are listed and `Q-B` stays the  
owner's — with the note that the port discards nothing silently anywhere else,  
which is an argument and not a proof.

**Smaller, each traced in the change table:** *no measurable cost* written out —  
never measured, and the design does not need it; `Mailbox._close` and  
`Pool._close` written apart with a table of which public call supplies the  
storage; the `_closed_fast` ordering levelled, named here and specified by  
3TK-53; the double-free interleaving demoted to an illustration with the  
argument about who owns the destroying above it; a thread may leave the mutex and  
remain active, as a normative sentence; the state diagram redrawn so `release` is  
one arrow to FREED; `close` split by tool, since only the pool's runs application  
code after CLOSED.

**Five points were held back, four of them for one reason.** The review asks for  
the document to be reorganized — repetition removed, specification separated from  
review history and implementation plan, a normative contract block promoted to  
the front — and for the negatives group to be renamed. **All of that is owed and  
none of it runs now.** The four blocking questions rewrite six of the sections a  
reorganization would move; doing it twice risks losing content for nothing.  
**It runs once, in the version that carries the owner's answers**, which is also  
the version that deletes the tags. The fifth is the reviewer's own answer to  
`Q-A`, which is a recommendation and is recorded as one.

**Verified live, with no source changed:** `run-builds.sh` **67 checks, 87 tests  
in each of the four builds, all four green, 0 failures**. `check-doc-loop.sh`  
**0 differing blocks, 440 sentences, 439 found**, the one pre-existing `inner.c3`  
miss, **0 banned words**. The ban scan over the new file leaves **0 hits in  
prose**; eight remain, all inside code blocks and all the same stdlib call name,  
which Part 5 exempts.

## 2026-08-28 — INTR 4, the review absorbed

**`3tk-lifetime-fix-002.md` is written, and `-001` is in `backup/`.** The input  
was `3tk-bug-fixes-review.md`, a twenty-point review of `-001`. **Every point is  
absorbed**, and the review file went to `backup/` with the version it reviewed —  
nothing has to be read out of it again. The document has a *What changed from  
`-001`* table naming the section each point landed in, so the absorption can be  
checked without holding the review beside it. **No byte of `3tk/src`, `test/` or  
`negative/` was touched.**

**Five things the review found that were genuinely missing**, and all five are  
now in the document.

**The lifetime invariant was never stated.** `-001` described a mechanism  
without the rule the mechanism serves. Section 2 now opens with it — `free` is  
legal only when `_closed` is true and `_active` is zero — with the  
`OPEN / CLOSED / QUIET / FREED` diagram under it. 3TK-53 and 3TK-54 implement  
against that, not against prose.

**"Every call raises the count" was too vague to implement.** Section 3 defines  
an *active operation* as any path that holds a valid reference and may still  
touch the memory, and enumerates every site on both tools. Section 4 pulls out  
the case `-001` made only about the pool: **`close` is itself active**, for its  
whole body, and that is precisely why release-racing-close can be supported.

**Lifetime waiting and hook serialization were running together in one word.**  
Section 11 separates them: a pool may run two hooks at once and still guarantee  
that release waits for both. Nothing in the invariant asks for an order between  
hooks. `Q-A` stays open, but it is now a smaller question than it looked.

**`-001` prescribed a destruction order it had not earned.** *`destroy; free`*  
skips the question of whether a mutex can be destroyed while held. Section 8  
sketches the sequence and hands the real order to 3TK-53, to be established  
against the real structs.

**The probe was overclaiming.** *The design does not change; the probe did not  
refuse* is broader than four green builds of a scratch module support. The probe  
section now says what it validates — the synchronization pattern — and lists six  
things it does not: the real life cycles, hook lifetime, concurrent close and  
release, the destruction order, the memory ordering around `_closed_fast`, and  
where `_active` lands in each tool's locking protocol.

**The contradiction the review calls the biggest problem is now a section of its  
own.** `Q5` was ruled on *the client's code is unaffected either way*; `Q-B`  
proposes `mbox.release(&iq)`, which is a client API change. **The two cannot both  
stand, and neither is the port's to drop.** Section 12 states it and names the  
two ways out — re-word the `Q5` ruling, or reject `Q-B` and design another  
destination for an open mailbox's items. **The reviewer would not start 3TK-53  
until it is resolved.** `Q-B` is therefore blocking, alongside `Q-A`.

**Section 19 is split, and no question is ruled.** Seven questions of three  
different kinds were in one list with no way to see which stops the code.  
Blocking now: `Q-A`, `Q-B`, `Q-C`, `Q-D`. Tracking: `Q-E`, `Q-F`, `Q-G`. `Q-D`  
is restated as the semantic question the review asked for — does the shared  
specification require `release` to wait for the calls in flight — with the  
procedural half under it. **The reviewer's recommendation on all seven is  
recorded in its own table, labelled as the reviewer's and ruled by nobody.**

**Smaller corrections**, each traced in the table: `_close` may be called twice  
and the second call transfers nothing; the ordering rule replaces the cost claim  
as the requirement; *release closes if it must* becomes the three-part life-cycle  
operation; Race A and Race B are named and the clause narrowed to the promise it  
can keep; `release vs release` is explained as a question of who owns the  
destroying; `P6`'s blocker is removed but its own question is explicitly not  
answered. **Two negatives were added** — `release` racing `close`, one per tool,  
distinct from the hook-parking tests.

**Nothing was removed from `-001`.** Every section is present, renumbered where  
new sections landed above it.

**One thing left alone.** [3tk-staging-plan-020.md](3tk-staging-plan-020.md)  
names `-001` in three places. The plan is published and Part 0 forbids editing it  
in place, so those lines stand; `-002`'s header says that where the plan names  
`-001`, this file is meant.

**Verified live, with no source changed:** `run-builds.sh` **67 checks, 87 tests  
in each of the four builds, all four green, 0 failures**. `check-doc-loop.sh` **0 differing blocks, 440  
sentences, 439 found**, the one pre-existing `inner.c3` miss, **0 banned words**.  
The ban scan over the new file leaves **0 hits in prose**; six remain, all of  
them `unlock` inside a code block — the quoted `pool.c3:421` line and five lines  
of pseudo-code — which Part 5 exempts as a stdlib call name.

## 2026-08-28 — 3TK-51, the accumulated description

**`3tk-lifetime-fix-001.md` is written.** The two advice files merged into one  
document: the one defect on two tools, the mechanism, `_close`, the mailbox's  
`out` parameter and its reverse-order `defer` case, the pool's hook window, the  
contradiction, who may release, the boundary the fix cannot cross, what stays  
unchanged, what it costs, `P6`, the negatives it owes, and seven open questions.  
**No byte of `3tk/src`, `test/` or `negative/` was touched.**

**The feasibility probe ran and did not refuse.** A scratch module compiled  
against `3tk/src` in all four builds: four workers entering under a mutex,  
working outside it, and leaving under it; a waiter blocking on the condition  
variable until the counter reached zero; the condition variable and the mutex  
destroyed and the heap block freed afterwards; and `wait_until` with no signal  
faulting with `thread::WAIT_TIMEOUT`. **`PROBE OK` in every build**, and elapsed  
0.10s against a 40ms working window — the waiter blocked rather than winning a  
race. **So the design changes nowhere.** The scratch module was written outside  
`3tk/` and removed; `3tk/` is clean.

**Three things the stage found and did not decide.**

**The contradiction is real and it blocks the code.** The pool advice's first  
half wants `on_close` to wait for the calls in flight — hook serialization — and  
its second half forbids turning the counter into a hook serializer. Serialization  
would reopen `Part 12.2` and `Part 12.3`, which
[3tk-on-close-policy-001.md](3tk-on-close-policy-001.md) ruled and closed on
2026-08-27. **Filed as `Q-A`. 3TK-53 and 3TK-54 cannot be written without it.**

**The two `release_open_*` programs are TIER 1 in `run-builds.sh`**, so their  
inversion is not only a rewrite of two files: they stop being tier 1 and  
`run-builds.sh` changes with them. That is written into the stages that own it.

**The `2DO` comment at `pool.c3:236` names `pool.c3:424` for the re-take of the  
mutex. It is at `:423` today.** Ordinary drift; the comment goes when 3TK-54  
writes the block out.

**One thing outside the stage, reported and not fixed:**
[3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md) links to `README.md` in this folder, and there is
no such file.

**Verified live, with no source changed:** `run-builds.sh` **67 checks, 87 tests,  
four builds green, 0 failures**. `check-doc-loop.sh` unchanged — 0 differing  
blocks, 440 sentences, 439 found, the one pre-existing `inner.c3` miss, 0 banned  
words. The ban scan over the new file leaves one hit, the quoted  
`self._mu.unlock();` source line, which Part 5 exempts as a stdlib call name.

## 2026-08-27 — plan 020 written, the lifetime fix staged

**Two advice files arrived** — `3tk-bugs- mailbox.md` and `3tk-bugs-pool.md`, the  
second of them carrying a whole second independent analysis under *Second advice*.  
They describe **one defect on two objects**, and it is the one already tracked as  
`Q5`: `always_assert(self._closed, ...)` at `mailbox.c3:106` and `pool.c3:231`  
checks state, not lifetime, so a release racing a call still in flight frees  
memory that call is using.

**Plan 019 was not spent, so 020 carries its leftover forward.** 3TK-48 and  
3TK-49 have run; **3TK-50 has not**, and where it falls against the new stages is  
the owner's, listed in 020 rather than decided.

**`3tk-staging-plan-020.md` declares 3TK-51 to 3TK-55.** The description first,  
then the shared-specification clause, then the mailbox, then the pool, then the  
books. **The order is forced**: 51 states the choice that 53 and 54 depend on, 52  
is a promise every port owes and 3tk must not make alone, and the mailbox is the  
same mechanism without the hook window — if it does not work there it will not  
work in the pool.

**The advices contradict each other on one rule, and the plan does not resolve  
it.** The pool file's first half recommends that `on_close` wait for in-flight  
`on_get` and `on_put` — hook serialization. Its second half says the opposite and  
keeps `Part 12.2`'s two `on_close` calls. **They cannot both hold**, and it is  
the question that decides how 53 and 54 are written.

**Three of the owner's requirements are written into the plan as rules.** Every  
document output is versioned, superseded version to `backup/`. **Every question  
and its answer lives inside the document**, never only in a conversation, and an  
answer makes the next version. **Every stage says whether to clear or compact and  
prints the line to continue with.**

**Tests are named per stage rather than left to the end.** Both  
`negative/release_open_*.c3` programs **invert** — releasing an open object stops  
being an abort — and five new deterministic negatives park a hook or a receiver  
until the main thread has called release. None of them is a flaky race.

**3TK-51 carries a feasibility probe.** The counter, the wait for zero and the  
tear-down, compiled against `3tk/src` in all four builds before any of it is  
written into the port. If the probe refuses, the design changes in 51 and not in  
53.

**No code was touched.** `3tk-status.md` updated: 020 is the live plan, and the  
resume section now names six unfinished stages instead of one.

## 2026-08-27 — the reviews folder removed, what it held absorbed

**The owner removed `reviews/`.** Four implementation reviews, `3tk-01` to  
`3tk-04`, plus the two analysis files. About 5100 lines. Nothing in `3tk/`  
depended on it and no script read it.

**Most of it needed no absorbing.** Every defect — `P1` to `P7`, `W1`, `W2`,  
`Q5` — already had its own section in `3tk-open-defects.md`, with the evidence  
and the verification. The record of what was wrong and what was done never lived  
in `reviews/`.

**Three things did, and moved.**

**The five refutations** are now a *Refuted* section in `3tk-open-defects.md`,  
before `Q5`. Each was a *required fix* in one of the four reviews and each is  
answered by a line of the port rather than by an argument — `must_from_handle`  
and `Inner.as` both carry `@require`, `required_alloc_offset` resolves in all  
four builds, `Slot` is a `typedef` and not an alias so the casts cannot be  
dropped, and `helper::init` writes `n.link` and nothing else. Rewritten so the  
evidence is the code: the old text cited *review 1 §1* and similar, and those  
files are gone.

**`W3`** is now inside `3tk-release-while-busy-001.md`, which was its only  
reader. Its *Interim* section had pointed at `reviews/` for it. It now states  
what `W3` is: a one-sentence warning on both `release` descriptors, written out  
again when enforcement lands, and owing the doc loop because both sites are  
inside `<* *>`.

**The priority ranking** did not move as a table. Six of the eight ranked items  
are fixed, so one line in *Order* carries what is left — `P6` was ranked High and  
is the last of the three that were.

**Dropped deliberately.** The list of review sections that claimed no defect,  
because it points into files that no longer exist and is unusable. The `Q1` to  
`Q3` answers, whose fixes are done and verified. Both *what was measured, live*  
sections, which are historical measurements this log already holds.

**`Q4` needed nothing.** Its ruling was already quoted in full inside `P5`'s  
section — the specification refuses the promotion, `Part 11.12` holds the port's  
only two tier-1 sites, and `Part 12.2` files a hook's wrong identity as a defect  
of the application.

**The defect list's opening block was rewritten.** It used to delegate the *why*  
to `reviews/` and forbid re-arguing from them. It now says the reasoning lives in  
that file and there is no second document to re-argue from.

**Links in this log still point at `reviews/`.** They are historical entries and  
record what existed when they were written. They are left as they are.

## 2026-08-27 — INTR 3 continued, the close-hook wording fixed, reference to 004

**The fix was smaller than the finding said.** Two of the three stale sites  
already carried the truthful lines directly beside the stale one.

**`pool.c3:92`, the hooks interface.** Lines 93 and 94 already read *called once  
by `close`, and possibly once more with stragglers from a concurrent `put`* and  
*so a hook must not free its own context on the first call*. Line 92 said *called  
once*. The block argued with itself. Only the word *once* was written out.

**`pool.c3:469`, `Pool.close`.** Nothing truthful beside it. Same word written  
out, and the *possibly once more* sentence added in the same words as line 92.  
The hook's obligation stays at the interface, where a hook writer is reading.

**`ref/3tk-reference-003.md:1039`.** The same two changes. The reference already  
held the truthful sentences in its hooks section at `:1091-1093`, so it carried  
both answers in one file.

**The reference is versioned.** `-003` to `backup/`, `-004` in its place, every  
live cross-reference repointed. Historical mentions in this log, in  
`3tk-status.md` and in `3tk-open-defects.md` still name `-003`, because that is  
what those entries recorded at the time. The version paragraph at the top of the  
reference was stale as well — it still said *this is 002* — and now names `004`  
with `003` and `002` summarised under it.

**Verified.** Doc loop 0 differing blocks, 440 sentences, 439 found, 1 missing,  
0 banned words. The one miss is the pre-existing `inner.c3` module summary. The  
count rose by one, which is the sentence added to `Pool.close`.

**No ruling was needed and none was taken.** The specification had already ruled  
it in `Part 12.2`; only 3tk's wording was behind.

**The Order section's *runs now* line is empty again.** `P6` and `Q5` are what is  
left.

## 2026-08-27 — INTR 3 continued, the defect list gets an Order section

**Why it was missing.** Six items were mechanical and ran in one stage, so  
ordering was trivial and nobody wrote it down. It stopped being trivial once the  
one open item's answers began depending on two other files.

**Added to `3tk-open-defects.md`, after the summary block and before the item  
sections.** Not at the top: a dependency list above the table names items the  
reader has not met yet. One pointer line in the opening block links down to it.

**Three headings and nothing else.** What runs now with nothing in front of it.  
What is waiting on the owner. What is waiting on an unscheduled stage. Then the  
one dependency a reader would not guess: `P6`'s option 1 needs `Q5`'s stage,  
because a count means nothing until there is a moment when no further `on_close`  
can arrive, and `Part 12.2` names no such moment. Options 2 and 3 do not need it,  
and either would put `P6` in front of everything else.

**Called *Order*, not *Priorities*.** The priority ranking already exists at  
`reviews/3tk-05-review-analysis-001.md:412`, and this file's own rule says the  
*why* lives in the reviews and is not re-argued here. Copying it would give two  
copies that drift, and six of the ranked items are fixed, so the ranking is  
mostly historical. Order is a fact about dependencies rather than a judgment.

**Kept out deliberately:** the fixed items, which have no order left, and stage  
scheduling such as `3TK-50`, which is `3tk-status.md`'s subject. Naming a stage  
in both files means editing both every time one moves.

**Two rules written into the section itself.** It is rewritten in the same edit  
that changes an item's state. And it is never the only place a dependency is  
recorded — each item's section keeps its own, so a stale line is a duplicate gone  
wrong rather than a fact lost.

## 2026-08-27 — INTR 3 continued, the close hook is not called once

**Looking at `P6`'s two close-hook sites turned up a different finding.**

**What was suspected.** `on_close` runs outside the mutex at `pool.c3:434` and  
`pool.c3:492`, and the two can run at the same time on two threads with two  
different lists. That reads as a broken *called once* promise.

**The specification had already ruled it.** `Part 12.2` of  
`../common/matryoshka-specification-004.md`, under *on close*: called once by  
close, and once more for each put that discovers the pool closed while its own  
hook was running, with the hook required to tolerate a later call. The clause was  
weakened deliberately in `003`, and `003` says why — two calls to a cleanup hook  
is a smaller cost than items with no holder. `Part 12.3` covers the concurrency:  
hooks run at once on different threads, and a hook protects its own state.

**So both axes are closed and the code is correct.** Nothing in `3tk/src`  
changes.

**What is wrong is the port's own wording.** Three sites still carry the `002`-era  
*called once*: `pool.c3:92`, `pool.c3:469`, `ref/3tk-reference-003.md:1039`. A  
hook writer who reads the descriptor writes a hook that runs once, and the second  
call finds state the first one tore down. Two of the three are inside `<* *>`, so  
the fix owes the doc loop and a `-004`.

**Two things outside 3tk were recorded, not ruled.** The user-facing  
`design/matryoshka-api-reference-042.md:1470` carries the same stale *calls it  
once*. And `Part 12.3` cites `3tk: pool.c3:445-480` for a window that is live at  
`pool.c3:421-445`.

**Written up as [3tk-on-close-policy-001.md](3tk-on-close-policy-001.md).** Not  
scheduled. `P6` is unchanged and keeps only the leak question.

## 2026-08-27 — INTR 3 continued, P6's third site ruled

**The owner ruled on `pool.c3:458-460`,** the third and smallest of `P6`'s  
sites: a put hook returns an item of an identity the pool was never created  
with.

**What it looked like.** A `mtk::@check` naming the fault, then a guard:

```c3
    mtk::@check(b != null, "the put hook returned an identity the pool was not created with");
    if (!b) return;
    b.free.push(h);
```

**In a checking build the `@check` stopped the program.** In a fast build the  
`@check` compiled out, the guard ran, and the item was dropped with nothing said.  
That silent drop is what made this a `P6` site at all — INTR 2 split `P5` and  
sent this half here.

**The ruling: write the guard out, keep its text at the line.**

```c3
    // if (!b) return; <- Force failure instead of silent bug
```

**Why this is a fix and not a removal.** With no guard, `b.free.push(h)` on a  
null `b` writes through a null pointer and the process dies. A checking build  
still stops at the `@check` with its message. A fast build now fails at the line  
instead of swallowing the item. Loud in both builds, which is exactly what the  
site lacked.

**The comment carries the reason.** Without it the next reader sees an unguarded  
dereference after a check that compiles out, calls it an oversight, and restores  
the guard. The comment says the absence is the decision.

**`Q4` is not touched.** `Q4` barred new always-on *check* sites the port adds.  
Nothing was added here; a guard was written out. The failure is a null  
dereference, not a `always_assert`, and the port's two tier-1 sites are still the  
two in `Part 11.12`.

**Same shape as the `P7` ruling, opposite direction.** `P7` kept a dead branch  
and wrote the reason at the line. This writes out a live branch and writes the  
reason at the line. Both leave a `//` comment where a later reader would  
otherwise guess.

**Verified.** Four builds green, passed 67, failed 0, 87 tests. The doc loop is  
untouched — a `//` comment is invisible to it, so no reference change and no  
`-004`.

**`P6` is still open on its two close-hook sites,** `pool.c3:434` and `:492`.  
The tally is unchanged: six fixed, one open, two closed, one deferred.

## 2026-08-27 — INTR 3 continued, P7 closed by reading the standard library

**`P7` was not a defect.** It claimed `Mailbox.receive` and `Pool.get_wait` could  
return a fault their `@return?` lines do not name, arriving from a failed timed  
wait on a condition variable. The owner asked for that claim to be confirmed  
rather than taken.

**The claim needs `wait_until` to be able to fail with something other than  
`thread::WAIT_TIMEOUT`.** It cannot. `thread.c3:102` is a macro that forwards;  
the body at `os/thread_posix.c3:179` has three exits — `ETIMEDOUT` returns  
`thread::WAIT_TIMEOUT`, `OK` returns success, and every other value calls  
`abort` inside the standard library, so control never comes back. OpenBSD folds  
its odd case into `WAIT_TIMEOUT`. The win32 file is the same: every `?` exit in  
its condition-variable code is `thread::WAIT_TIMEOUT~`, at `:329`, `:341`,  
`:348`. So `f` is only ever `WAIT_TIMEOUT`, the comparison is always false, and  
the branch is dead.

**The `@return?` lines were never incomplete**, so there was no eighth fault to  
name and nothing for the owner to rule on.

**What was done.** The owner ruled: keep the branch, add a plain `//` comment on  
the right of each line. `mailbox.c3:257` and `pool.c3:370` now carry *dead today:  
wait_until can only fail with WAIT_TIMEOUT, kept for future wait failures*.  
Keeping it means the port does not lean silently on a promise that lives in  
another library's operating-system layer; if `wait_until` ever grows a second  
fault, a port without the guard would report it as a timeout.

**No documentation debt.** The doc loop reads only `<* *>` text, so a `//` line  
is invisible to it — no reference change, no `-004`. Verified after the edit:  
four builds green, 67 checks, 87 tests, 0 failures; doc loop 0 differing blocks,  
439 sentences with the one pre-existing `inner.c3` module summary missing, 0  
banned words.

**On the record, and a different subject.** That `abort` is a tier-1 site the  
port did not add and cannot avoid, so `Q4` is untouched — `Q4` governs sites the  
port adds. A `pthread_cond_timedwait` failure kills the process rather than  
returning through `void?`.

**`3tk-open-defects.md` now reads six fixed, one open, two closed, one  
deferred.** `P6` is the only ruling still owed.

---

## 2026-08-27 — INTR 3, the six items that needed no ruling

**One stage, six fixes, verified.** `P1`, `P2`, `P3`, `P4`, `W1`, `W2` — every  
item on [3tk-open-defects.md](3tk-open-defects.md) that did not need a decision  
from the owner first.

- **`P2`** — `required_alloc_offset` was declared twice, identically. The copy in
  `managed.c3` had no reader: both call sites name the `mtk::inner` one  
  qualified. The copy is gone. This was first, because `P1` edits the survivor.
- **`P1`** — that survivor overwrote on every match and took the last `Allocator`
  field silently, so which allocator `release` returned the memory to was decided  
  by declaration order. It counts now, the way `inner_offset` has always counted,  
  and both messages name the type. New negative,  
  `nocompile_managed_two_allocators.c3`, refused in all four modes.
- **`P3`** — `Mailbox.receive_all` and `Mailbox.close` both say the caller's
  queue must be empty and neither checked it. Both now open with  
  `mtk::@check(out.is_empty(), ...)`. Tier 2, no paired `if`: appending onto a  
  non-empty queue in a fast build is defined, not a hole.
- **`P4`** — two `Part 2.6` signals that could not fire, in `Mailbox.receive` and
  `Pool.get_wait`. Deleted with their branch-level markers. The MUST is kept by  
  the dequeue two lines above, and by a stronger route: a waiter that finds an  
  item does not leave at all. The FUNCTION-level markers stand. The `A3`  
  precedent is cited in the decisions entry, which is what keeps this from  
  looking like a dropped MUST.
- **`W1`** — `Pool.put`'s *unchanged* now says the pool refused it before any
  hook ran, which is the only way it happens.
- **`W2`** — the `on_get` identity rule now says which build catches it: a
  checking build, and not a fast one.

**Two files under `ref/` became `-003`, and `-002` went to `backup/`.** The  
reference carries `W1` and `W2`'s sentences and moves `required_alloc_offset`  
into the compile-time section where it is actually declared. The decisions file  
gains an entry per item — **and every `file:line` citation in it was  
re-anchored**, which it needed anyway: yesterday's `2DO` comments had already  
made them stale. `check-doc-loop.sh`, `move-module-docs.sh`, `doc_blocks.py`,  
`README.md`, `3tk-status.md` and the defects list all name `-003` now.

**Verified.** Four builds green, **67 checks** (63 before; the new negative runs  
once per build), 87 tests, 0 failures. Doc loop: 0 differing blocks, 439  
sentences, 438 found, 1 missing — the same pre-existing `inner.c3` module  
summary — and 0 banned words.

**Two items remain open and both are the owner's:** `P6`, what the pool does when  
a close hook leaves items behind, and `P7`, whether a condition-variable failure  
is a defect or an eighth fault. Neither can be coded until one question each is  
answered.

---

## 2026-08-27 — quiet before released, ruled and deferred

**An owner ruling on INTR 2's `Q5`, and no stage.** One document, no code.

**The port enforces it.** Not a documented caller precondition — the owner's  
reason is that the client's code is unaffected either way, so the port may as well  
keep the rule itself.

**It does not run now.** The examples and the pattern catalog do not exercise edge  
cases, so nothing downstream waits on it and the gap may be long. That is why it  
got a file of its own rather than a line in a plan.

**The advice that went with the ruling is in the file**, because it is the part  
that would otherwise be lost: a counter alone has the hazard inside itself — the  
counter and its mutex live in the memory being freed — so `release` must **wait  
on a condition variable until the count is zero**, which means `release` stops  
being a call that cannot block. And `Part 11.12` is in the shared specification, so 3tk would be  
*discovering* the clause for every port, not implementing one.

Written: `3tk-release-while-busy-001.md`.

**Two `2DO` comments went into the code the same day**, at the owner's word and  
in the owner's format, on `Mailbox.release` and `Pool.release`. **Plain `//`  
lines, not doc blocks** — verified first: in a `.c3` file both of  
`check-doc-loop.sh`'s scans read only the `<* *>` text, so the comments are  
invisible to the doc loop and to the banned-word scan. Four builds green, doc  
loop unchanged at 0 differing blocks, banned words 0, and the `items?` count  
still 484. **The doc loop is not owed and 3TK-50 is not blocked.**

**Two renames, both for a banned word.** `reviews/3tk-06-questions-settled-001.md`  
became `...-answered-001.md`, and the file written for the release hazard lost  
the word *quiescence* from its name — it is `3tk-release-while-busy-001.md`.  
Every reference repointed, including the two `2DO` comments. The word *drain* was  
also caught in the new prose and replaced with *wait*: it is on Part 5's list, and  
`release` waiting for calls in flight is what the ruling actually says.

**And the eight open items got a working file: `3tk-open-defects.md`.** One  
table, one section each — where it is, what is wrong, what the fix is, how to  
know it worked, and its state. **Edited in place**, like the status file and this  
one, because it is ticked off rather than superseded.

**Writing it moved two things.** `P4` is not the simple deletion it looked like:  
its marker is `Part 2.6`, a MUST, and the port's compliance is real but comes  
from the dequeue two lines above rather than from the vacuous branch — so the  
deletion needs a decisions entry or the port looks like it dropped a MUST. And  
`P6` and `P7` turned out **not** to be mechanical: each needs a small ruling  
first, because the port has no way to report what it noticed, and `Q4` closed the  
door on new tier-1 aborts. Both rulings are written out in their sections.

**The line numbers in the two review files are now stale** — the `2DO` comments  
moved them, by five in `mailbox.c3` and six in `pool.c3`. `3tk-open-defects.md`  
was printed live afterwards and is the good copy.

## 2026-08-26 — INTR 2, the five questions answered

**Ran on the owner's word, second of the implementation-review interrupt.** One  
document under `reviews/`, no code, and no byte of `3tk/` changed.

**INTR 1 had left five questions**, each with the check that settles it named.  
INTR 2 ran all five. **Four are closed as readings.** `Pool.put`'s fork is not a  
fork — the closed-window disposal was ruled 2026-08-24 and `on_put` has no  
give-it-back outcome, so the contract sentence is the defect and the code is not.  
`UNKNOWN_IDENTITY`'s fault-and-defect split is what its negative was written to  
assert. The empty-Slot no-op is `D6`'s pairing clause, not an exception to it —  
without the `if`, a fast build pushes a null handle and dereferences it. And the  
hook checks stay tier 2, because `Part 11.12` calls its own precondition *the one  
the toolkit refuses to soften* and `Part 12.2` files a hook's wrong identity as an  
ordinary defect of the application.

**Q5 is the one thing left, and it is a sentence.** `Part 11.12` promises  
closed-before-released and nothing else; `Part 13.1` is the allocator rule and has  
nothing to say here. So *quiet before released* was never promised, it is the  
caller's to keep, and it is written down nowhere — while `Pool.put` opens the  
window itself, under `Part 12.3`'s MUST. Three ways out are listed and **INTR 2  
does not choose**.

**P5 came apart under Q4.** Its promotion is refused by the specification, so it  
closes as a checking question: `pool.c3:318` becomes a wording item, and  
`pool.c3:453` merges into P6, which inherits the priority. Six problems and three  
wording items remain, and only the last of the three is blocked.

**Measured live:** `./3tk/run-builds.sh` — four builds green, 63 checks, 0  
failures. The tree is where 3TK-49 left it.

Written: `reviews/3tk-06-questions-answered-001.md`.

## 2026-08-26 — INTR 1, the four implementation reviews triaged

**Ran on the owner's word, and it interrupted plan 019 between 3TK-49 and  
3TK-50.** One document under `reviews/`, no code, and no byte of `3tk/` changed.

**Four review files, 4,350 lines, written from the sources with comments and  
documents excluded.** That exclusion cost the reviewer his headline: in C3 a  
`<* @require *>` block is a compiled contract, so *`must_from_handle` performs no  
identity check* is a false alarm about a line he was told to skip, and  
`negative/wrong_type_must.c3` already proves it. Four more claims were refuted the  
same way, and the sections that found nothing are listed so they are not re-read.

**Seven problems survived**, `P1` to `P7`, each with live `file:line` and a  
ranking. Six are the reviewer's; **P7 is the analysis's own** — a `std::thread`  
fault escaping past a `@return?` that declares a closed set. **Five questions were  
left for the owner**, each naming the check that settles it, and INTR 2 ran them.

Written: `reviews/3tk-05-review-analysis-001.md`.

---

## 2026-08-26 — 3TK-49, the pattern catalog

**Ran on the owner's word, second of plan 019's three.** One document under  
`ref/`, no code, and no byte of `3tk/` changed.

**The catalog is 62 numbered patterns**, each with *when to use*, a code shape  
and *why*, behind an opening index that is a number, a name and a hook. The  
description lives in the entry and the index routes to it — 3TK-48's rule,  
obeyed rather than restated.

**The classification was the work.** ztk's `patterns-029.md` has 75 entries. **38  
carry over in meaning, 16 change shape in C3, 1 inverts, 20 drop.** 55 cross,  
and 7 shapes have no ztk entry behind them at all. The 20 that drop are listed  
one by one at the end of the file, each with the `std.Io` declaration it rests  
on, **so a later stage does not go looking for something that was never  
forgotten.**

**The inversion is the interesting one, and it was measured rather than  
argued.** ztk makes *No switch over tags* a MUST because a Zig tag is a global's  
address, which the linker assigns, so a prong cannot be known while compiling.  
**A C3 `typeid` is a compile-time constant.** `switch (h.link.type)` with `case  
Event::typeid:` prongs compiles in all four builds. It is entry 19, the block  
is in the file, and the entry also says why a chain is still the better shape  
for two or three identities — the prong asserts where a chain asks, and an  
assertion is gone in a fast build.

**Everything was compiled, in one module, by script.** 48 fenced ` ```c3 `  
blocks extracted from the finished file and built against `3tk/src` in all four  
builds. **The extraction is by script and not by hand**, so a block that is  
edited later and not re-run cannot go unnoticed. The scratch output was removed;  
no `headers/` was generated.

**The compiler corrected three claims while the file was being written, and all  
three are now in it.**

- **A shared release function forces every demo outer to carry an
  `Allocator`.** The chain calls `mtk::managed::release` in every branch, and an  
  outer without the field does not compile in one — the build names the type and  
  the helper to use instead. That is not a detail of the demo types; it is a  
  constraint on any application that wants one release function.
- **`Pool.create` copies the identity list into its buckets**, so the local
  `typeid[3]` at a call site is right and does not dangle. Checked in  
  `pool.c3` rather than assumed, because the catalog teaches the shape.
- **`Msg.typeid` does not compile; `Msg::typeid` does.** `run-builds.sh` has
  carried that finding in a comment since `release_open_pool` spent weeks  
  passing without proving anything.

**One thing the catalog reports instead of smoothing over.** 3tk's  
`mailbox::create` and `pool::create` return a pointer, so ztk's acquisition  
Slot, its detach line and the window between them go away — **and so does what  
that window bought.** A coordinator acquiring two resources has no `errdefer`  
shape to lean on: if the second create fails, the first resource is open and  
allocated. **Entry 51 says that in the entry rather than showing a leak and  
calling it a pattern.**

**The `Item` count in `ref/` was re-run live at the moment of the claim** and  
moved 346 to 360. All 14 are in the two files the rule produced — 8 in the rules  
document, every one the rule naming the word to ban it, and 6 in the catalog,  
one restating the rule and five ztk entry titles quoted as titles. **Nothing was  
added to the old tree**, and both the rules document and the status file's *Open  
questions* carry the new number with that reason beside it.

**One pointer corrected in `ref/3tk-example-rules-001.md`.** 3TK-48 wrote *it is  
not linked here because it does not exist yet*; it exists now, so the sentence  
became the link. **No rule was changed and the document stays `001`** — a stage  
versions the catalog it revises, not a link target.

**Verification.** `run-builds.sh` green, 63 checks, 87 tests, four builds.  
`check-doc-loop.sh` unchanged: 0 differing blocks, 439 sentences, 438 found, 1  
missing. Ban scan 0. Every link and all 62 index anchors printed and checked, 0  
dead.

*Advice on clear: clear now. 3TK-50's inputs are the rules document and the  
catalog, and it is the first stage of plan 019 that writes code.*  
*Continue with:* `Read design/secondary/lang/c3/3tk-status.md. Run 3TK-50.`

## 2026-08-26 — 3TK-48, the rules for an example

**Ran on the owner's word, first of plan 019's three.** One document under  
`ref/`, two pointers, a status row and this entry. **No code.** Not `3tk/src`,  
not `test/`, not `negative/`, and no `examples/` folder — 3TK-50 creates that.

**[ref/3tk-example-rules-001.md](ref/3tk-example-rules-001.md)**, the sibling of
[ref/3tk-doc-loop-003.md](ref/3tk-doc-loop-003.md). Like it, a procedure: it
writes no row of its own, and the stage that uses it writes those.

**Why it exists.** The rules were derived in a conversation on 2026-08-26, from  
ztk's `rules-049.md`, its `examples/` tree and 3tk's own measurements. They bind  
two stages that have not run and every later stage that adds an example. **A  
rule that lives in a plan gets re-derived; a rule that lives in `ref/` gets  
read.** They are normative where the catalog is descriptive, so mixing them into  
the catalog would mean editing the catalog to change a rule.

### What it says

Fourteen sections. The order is the order a person writes an example in.

- **The word is Outer — MUST**, first, with its scope paragraph and the four
  counts.
- **The four trees**, `examples/` as `exm::`, and **one file per module** —
  C3 gives a module one description and `c3c docgen` keeps whichever file it  
  reaches first, which is 3TK-38's defect and what 3TK-44 already paid for.
- **The file name.** `NNN-name.c3` declaring `module exm::name;`. The two
  necessarily differ, because a C3 module name takes no leading digit and no  
  hyphen — a language constraint, written down so no stage reads it as a defect.
- **What an example is.** Real C3, no `@test`, no `always_assert`, nothing from
  `mtk_test`; the outers are `exm::outers`' and never `test/common.c3`'s; an  
  `Allocator` parameter and `mtk::managed` rather than a raw allocator call;  
  **cleanup registered before the acquisition**; reporting by returning; a check  
  through `exm::helpers::expect` with a fault the example declares itself.
- **Completeness**, **two levels**, and **the description written like the
  code**, in the register the doc loop measured: no numbered lists, no tables,  
  no nested bullets, diagrams fenced.
- **The wrapper in `test/`** as the only place `always_assert` appears.
- **An index routes and never copies**, with the three triggers that would earn
  the catalog's index a file of its own.
- **Dispatch**, **what binds `src/` and nothing else**, **what binds a stage**,
  and **what is not taken from ztk**.

### The four counts, re-measured

**Re-run live at the moment of the claim**, per the live-scan rule, with  
`grep -roiwE 'items?'`. All four are what plan 019 recorded: **124 in  
`3tk/src`, 203 in `3tk/test` and `3tk/negative`, 346 in `ref/`, 164 in  
`../common/matryoshka-specification-004.md`.**

**The rule binds new work only**, and the scope paragraph says so with the  
reason: the last count is the shared input binding otk, ztk and dtk, and 3tk  
does not reword a `common/` document for the other three ports. **The document  
is now the first of the three places the debt is recorded** — the other two are
[3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md)'s *Open questions* and
[3tk-port-findings-003.md](3tk-port-findings-003.md).

### What was inherited, and what was refused

**Ported, never copied.** Taken: one quality bar, completeness, no testing API  
inside an example, the shared `expect`, *catalog docs are an index not a copy*,  
description-as-code, fenced diagrams, the live-scan rule, the final branch of a  
dispatch chain, and the handler transfer rule.

**One rule inverted.** ztk's *No switch over tags — MUST* rests on a Zig tag  
being a linker-assigned address. **A C3 `typeid` has no such problem, so in 3tk  
the prohibition becomes a permitted shape** — subject to a stage compiling it in  
all four builds before it writes it down.

**Three refused on the record**, so no later stage adopts one by accident: the  
quoted-identifier ban and the doc-target-size rule are defects of Zig autodoc  
and mkdocs, and 3tk ships through neither; stories, which 3tk has no tree for;  
and every Master rule resting on `Io.Select`, `Io.Group` or `Future`, which went  
out with the owner's `std.Io` ruling.

**One forward reference is deliberately not a link.** `ref/3tk-patterns-001.md`  
does not exist until 3TK-49 writes it, and a link to it would be a dead link  
today.

### Verification

- **Ban scan run live over the finished file: 0.** The only `Item` and `Items`
  hits are the rule naming the word in order to ban it, and the count table  
  naming what it counts — the same carve-out `rules-049.md` Part 5 gives its  
  own text.
- **Every link printed and read, both directions. 0 dead.**
- **The four counts re-run live**, above.
- Part 6's markdown rules by script, fenced blocks skipped: 0 trailing `\`,
  0 lists without a blank line before them.
- `./3tk/run-builds.sh` — four builds green, 63 checks, 87 tests. A formality
  here, run rather than assumed.
- `./3tk/check-doc-loop.sh` — **unchanged: 0 differing blocks, 439 sentences,
  438 found, 1 missing.**
- **No `git`. No edit to `../common/`. Nothing said to dtk.**

**Two pointers added**, both to files that index the live `ref/` documents:
[README.md](README.md) and [3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md). **README's *current
plan* row still named 017 and now names 019** — the index was stale by two  
plans.

**Next: 3TK-49, the pattern catalog, after a clear.** The line is in
[3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md).

---

## 2026-08-26 — plan 019, written

**Written after plan 018 was spent**, from a conversation with the owner rather  
than from a stage. No source touched, no reference edited: the plan file, and  
the pointers to it.

**What the conversation was about.** The toolkit is written down and the way to  
use it is not. Two gaps the owner named, and a third found by measuring the 87  
tests against ztk's scenario lists.

**Three gaps, measured live rather than argued.**

- **33 declaration lines in six test files put an outer on the stack, 41
  outers in all.** `managed::create` has 13 call sites, 10 of them in `test/`.  
  A stack outer cannot be released, so the cleanup half of every pattern in  
  `patterns-029.md` is invisible.
- **`switch` occurs 0 times** in `3tk/src`, `3tk/test` and `3tk/negative`,
  though 3TK-4 measured that C3 does what ztk cannot and the probe printed  
  `switch: Job`. That probe predates 3TK-21 and the `any`-shaped `Inner`.
- **Every pool in `3tk/test` is built with exactly one identity** —
  `typeid[1] tags = { Holder::typeid }`, at all six sites. The only multi-tag  
  array in the tree is the negative that exists to be refused. **So  
  `on_get(typeid want, ...)` has never had to choose**, and that is why the  
  second gap is there: nothing in the suite forces a dispatch.

**What the owner ruled in that conversation**, each named in the plan so no  
stage re-opens it.

- **`std.Io` is out.** `Future`, `Io.Group`, `io.concurrent`, `Io.Select` and
  `error.Canceled` are Zig's. Roughly half of `patterns-029.md` goes with them,  
  and `ItemList` with it.
- **The existing 87 tests are not touched**, and neither is `test/common.c3`.
  They probe the implementation; the examples demonstrate it.
- **The examples are separated from the tests**, and the reason is the one that
  settles it: **a pattern has to be showable in documentation**, and a file  
  carrying `@test` and `always_assert` cannot be shown. A fourth tree beside  
  `src/`, `test/` and `negative/`, supermodule `exm`.
- **A file name carries a numeric prefix**, as ztk's do, so it correlates with a
  numbered entry in a list.
- **3tk's rules for its own examples go under `ref/`**, editable, so a later
  stage follows them instead of re-deriving them.
- **The catalog comes before the mapping.** Which pattern lands in which file is
  decided after the catalog exists.
- **Never `Item` or `Items`. Always `Outer` and `Outers`** — in everything these
  stages write.
- **LE import order and the SPDX header bind `src/` and nothing else.**
- **3tk has priority over the terminology drift**, which is written down rather
  than fixed.

**Two of the port's own conventions were found by reading, and one of them  
corrects a claim made in the conversation.**

- **C3 permits imports at the bottom, and three `src/` files already do it** —
  `pool.c3` 512-517 of 518, `mailbox.c3` 358-363 of 363, `managed.c3` 85-88 of
  88. Five others put them at the top. **The claim that C3 requires imports at
  the top was false**, and the owner caught it. The port follows ztk's LE rule  
  in part of `src/` without ever having stated it.
- **The SPDX header is on 8 of 8 `src/*.c3` and on nothing else** — not
  `test/`, not `negative/`, not the scripts. The owner adds them. **The mover  
  leaves them alone**: `doc_blocks.py`'s `source_block` bounds the block at its  
  own `<*` and never walks above it, checked by reading.

**What ztk's `examples/` tree taught, read the same day.** `items.zig` is not a  
bag of structs — `freeItem` is the item-first chain, `createByTag` and  
`destroyByTag` are the tag-first chains, and the closing `else` is `unreachable`  
with the reason beside it. **The dispatch chains are written once and reused by  
every example.** `helpers/` holds the check that survives every build mode, and  
`hooks/` holds reusable pool hooks, one of which is backpressure — ztk scenario  
78, which 3tk has no test for. All three announce themselves as scaffolding in  
their own doc comment.

**And one C3 constraint the tree must respect, which this folder has already  
paid for.** 3TK-44 split `module mtk` across four files into eight one-file  
modules because C3 gives a module one description and `c3c docgen` keeps  
whichever file it reaches first. **One file per module under `examples/`**, so  
the demo outers are one `outers.c3` and not four files.

**`rules-049.md` was read for its tests, examples and Master material**, so a  
3tk rule with a ztk precedent is inherited rather than re-derived. Two of its  
rules changed the plan: **completeness** — a get-then-put example with no source  
and no destination is not a pattern — which the exemplar as first drafted failed;  
and **no testing API inside an example**, whose 3tk answer is neither `assert`  
nor `always_assert` but a shared `expect` taking a fault the example declares.  
**One inverts**: *No switch over tags — MUST* rests on a tag being a  
linker-assigned address, and C3's `typeid` has no such problem.

**The terminology drift is recorded and not repaired.** Counted live: 124 in  
`3tk/src`, 203 in `3tk/test` and `3tk/negative`, 346 in `ref/`, and **164 in  
`../common/matryoshka-specification-004.md`**. The last is the shared input  
binding otk, ztk and dtk, and 3tk does not reword a `common/` document for the  
other three ports. **The deadline is dtk's first stage** — dtk builds from the  
specification alone, so the first dtk stage bakes the word into a fourth port.

**Three stages, in a forced order.** 48 writes the rules 49 and 50 obey; 49  
decides which patterns exist and therefore how many files there are; 50 cannot  
run before either. **The pattern groups are not in this plan** — how many stages  
they need depends on 49's classification, and a plan 020 declares them.

**Declared, not authorized.** The continue line for 3TK-48 is in
[3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md).

---

## 2026-08-26 — the flow document is 003

**Not a stage.** A revision on the owner's word, the same day 3TK-47 reported  
the two places `ref/3tk-doc-loop-002.md` had fallen behind. `002` is in  
`backup/`, `001` before it.

**Two sections, and nothing else.** The invariant, the three modes, the register  
and the rules for moving a module description are `002`'s word for word.

**The checker script.** `002` listed two reports and the script has three. The  
module-block `diff` is named first, the descriptor check second, the ban scan  
third, and the exit status covers all three. **The mover has a subsection of its  
own**: `in` is `from-reference`, `out` is `to-reference`, `roundtrip` writes  
neither side, and `3tk/doc_blocks.py` is named as the one place the format  
lives, so the checker and the mover cannot drift apart.

**The module header.** `002` forbade a `<* *>` block above `module mtk;` in  
`inner.c3`, `queue.c3` and `stack.c3`, because four files declared one module  
and C3 keeps one description per module. **3TK-44 removed the premise.** Those  
three declare `mtk::inner`, `mtk::queue` and `mtk::stack` now, so no two files  
can collide. Left standing, the rule read as a prohibition 3TK-47 broke.  
**The measurement is kept — it is C3's, not this port's — and the rule is  
rewritten**: one module block per file, above that file's own `module` line,  
with `002`'s prohibition named as what returns if two files ever declare one  
module again.

**Live pointers repointed, records left alone.** `README.md`, `3tk-status.md`'s  
header pointer and its live guidance, `ref/3tk-reference-002.md`'s two links,  
and the three scripts. The rows recording 3TK-39, 3TK-43 and 3TK-46 keep the  
name they were written with.

**One judgement named rather than passed over.** Repointing two links inside  
`ref/3tk-reference-002.md` touched the reference, and a stage revising the  
reference versions it. **Two link targets are not a revision of its content**:  
no sentence changed, and the checker reports 0 differing blocks and the same  
438 of 439 afterwards. **The reference stays `002`.**

**Ban scan run live over `003`: 6 hits, all carried from `002`** — rule text  
naming a banned word, `@ensure` as a contract name, and 3TK-39's three record  
rows quoting the comments it found. **One hit was this revision's own prose**,  
*on purpose* at the new paragraph about the two reports, and it was rewritten  
before anything else was checked.

**Verification.** `check-doc-loop.sh`: 0 differing blocks over eight, 439  
sentences, 438 found, 1 missing, ban scan 0. `run-builds.sh`: four builds green,  
63 checks, 0 failed, 87 tests in each. **No file in `3tk/src` was touched** —  
the only script changes are comment lines naming the document.

---

## 2026-08-26 — 3TK-47, the move, and the checker

**Ran on the owner's word, fifth of plan 018 and the one that finishes it.  
The first stage where a module description was moved by a script rather than by  
a reading.**

**Two new files beside `run-builds.sh`.** `3tk/doc_blocks.py` holds the two  
sides and the one transformation — a labelled block in the reference, the  
`<* *>` block directly above `module X;`, and one leading space per line added  
going in and stripped coming out. A blank line stays blank.  
`3tk/move-module-docs.sh` is the copy itself: `in`, `out`, and `roundtrip`.  
Both readers share the parser, so there is one place where the format lives.

**`check-doc-loop.sh` learned the second kind of check.** For a labelled block:  
transform and `diff`, any difference named by module and printed as a unified  
diff. For everything else: the sentence-subset check, unchanged. **The two  
report separately and the exit status covers both.**

**The eight blocks moved, `mtk` first.** `mtk`, `mtk::helper`, `mtk::inner`,  
`mtk::mailbox`, `mtk::managed`, `mtk::pool`, `mtk::queue`, `mtk::stack`. Three  
were insertions — `inner.c3`, `queue.c3` and `stack.c3` had no module block at  
all, and each now has one above its `module` line. **No `// [3tk: ...]` mark was  
touched and no declaration's `<* *>` was read.**

**The round trip is byte-exact.** In and back out on a copy of both sides, twice:  
`diff` over the reference reports nothing. The format holds without adjusting a  
file until it passes.

**Two intended changes to `3tk/src`, both made by copying.**

- **The owner's markdown probe in `mtk.c3` is gone**, replaced by Part 1's
  block. Six of the seven missing sentences went with it.
- **`pool.c3`'s `put_all` fence said `mtk::Handle`.** It now says `Handle`.
  `mtk::Handle` no longer occurs anywhere in `3tk/src`, `3tk/test` or  
  `3tk/negative`.

**`mtk.c3` was being edited while this stage ran, for the second stage running.**  
The move wrote the file at 17:47:28; an editor wrote the probe back at 17:47:33.  
The move was re-run for `mtk` alone and the builds re-run after it. **The  
`alias` experiment 3TK-46 reported is no longer in the file, and 47 neither  
removed it nor ruled on it** — whether `mtk` re-exports the helper crossings is  
still the owner's question.

**Verification, all run and none read.** `c3c docgen`, and the eight module  
pages read out of the generated page rather than out of the source: eight  
modules with a description, 26 doc lines on `mtk`, and the `mtk` page opens with  
*An item-transfer and item-reuse toolkit for concurrent C3 programs.*  
`formatDocText` extracted from that page and run under `node` over all eight  
blocks — **one rendered line per source line, eight for eight**, and  
`mtk::pool`'s fence one `<pre><code>`. `check-doc-loop.sh`: **0 differing  
blocks over eight**, and **439 sentences, 438 found, 1 missing** — the count  
rose because the blocks are longer, and the one missing is `inner.c3`'s merged  
file header, 3TK-40's question. Ban scan run live: **0** over the eight sources  
and over `3tk-reference-002.md`. `run-builds.sh`: **four builds green, 63  
checks, 0 failed, 87 tests in each of the four.**

**One thing reported rather than fixed.** `ref/3tk-doc-loop-002.md` says under  
*Moving a module description* that a module block is diffed — that part is  
right. But its *The checker script* section still lists only the descriptor  
check and the ban scan. **47 did not revise it**: the plan gave 47 no flow-  
document work, and versioning it to `003` would repoint links in four files.  
**Whether that section is brought up to the script is the owner's call.**

**Plan 018 is spent. The continue line is in [3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md).**

---

## 2026-08-26 — 3TK-46, eight sections, eight labels

**Ran on the owner's word, fourth of plan 018. `ref/` only, and not one byte of  
`3tk/src`.**

**`ref/3tk-reference-001.md` became `002`.** A stage that revises it versions  
it. `001` is in `backup/`. Live pointers repointed — `README.md`, all four in  
`ref/3tk-doc-loop-002.md`, `3tk-status.md`'s header line and its open question  
about `ref/3tk-api-002.md`, and `3tk/check-doc-loop.sh`'s `REF` default.  
Historical rows keep the name they were written with.

**The eight blocks live in one place: Part 7's new *The modules, one by one*.**  
Plan 018 said three modules have a section a description *could come from* —  
Part 1, Part 4's opening, Part 5's opening — and that is what happened: all  
eight blocks are derived, and putting the derived text under the part that  
already holds the module layout is what kept Parts 3 to 5 undisturbed. Part 7's  
own opening went from three things to four.

**Every block is delimited by an HTML comment carrying the module's name.**  
Eight open, eight close, eight distinct names, counted by a fence-aware script.  
The example in the prose uses `mtk::NAME` so a counter never sees nine.

**The five that had no section of their own now have one**: `mtk::inner`,  
`mtk::queue`, `mtk::stack`, `mtk::helper`, `mtk::managed`. Each is written from  
Part 3's groups and nothing else. `mtk::stack`'s is 3TK-45's text.

**The *Usual flow* question was answered per module, not once for all.** Six of  
the eight have no *Usual flow* of their own, so there was nothing to decide.  
The two that do — `mtk::mailbox` and `mtk::pool` — have it as a numbered list  
with nested bullets, and neither shape survives `formatDocText`. **The list was  
left out of both blocks, and its one-line summary was carried**: *Create, send,  
receive, close, release.* and *Write the hooks, create, get, put, close,  
release.*, each with the plain sentences that sit under the steps. **No numbered  
list was reshaped into flat bullets** — the summary line already says what the  
step names say, and flattening would have produced two spellings of one fact.

**No bold in any block.** The intersection allows `**bold**` and the register  
forbids it, and the register is the narrower rule. The four module blocks  
already in `3tk/src` have no bold either, which is the precedent.

**One divergence found by writing the block.** `pool.c3`'s module block opens  
its `put_all` fence with `while (mtk::Handle h = ...)`. There is no  
`mtk::Handle` — `Handle` is declared in `mtk::inner`, and that spelling is its  
only occurrence in `3tk/src`, `3tk/test` and `3tk/negative`. Part 5 says  
`Handle`. **The block follows the reference, so 3TK-47's copy corrects the  
source.**

**One fact in the reference was corrected rather than copied.** Part 7's module  
layout still said `module mtk` is declared by four files and listed five  
modules, with `InnerQueue` and `InnerStack` inside `mtk`. 3TK-44 made it eight  
modules and reported that it had left the sentence standing. The table is now  
eight rows, module and file, with a REVISED note naming what `001` said and who  
changed it. **Nothing was invented: the split is recorded state.**

**Verification.** Both renderers run, never read. `formatDocText` extracted from  
a freshly generated `docs.html` and run under `node` over all eight blocks in  
their source form — **one rendered line per source line, eight for eight**, and  
`mtk::pool`'s fence renders as one highlighted `<pre><code>`. The same eight  
rendered as CommonMark — **flowing paragraphs, zero hard breaks, every label  
invisible.** `check-doc-loop.sh`: 337 sentences, 330 found, **the same 7  
missing as before**, which is what no source touched has to mean. Ban scan 0  
over the eight sources and over `3tk-reference-002.md`, and run live over  
`README.md` — 0 — and over this file and `3tk-status.md`, where every hit is  
pre-existing prose naming a banned word or quoting the list.

**The first build run read `mtk.c3` mid-save and is not the run this entry  
reports.** At 17:33 the file ended `alias ` with no right-hand side; `c3c`  
refused it and `run-builds.sh` reported 29 passed, 34 failed, every failure the  
same parse error at `mtk.c3:63`. Moments later the line read  
`alias to_handle = mtk::helper::to_handle;`. **3TK-46 wrote nothing to  
`3tk/src`** — it read a file being typed into, which is a hazard of verifying  
against a live tree and worth naming once. **Re-run against the completed file:  
four builds green, 63 checks, 0 failed, 87 tests in each of the four.**

**Re-export aliases are appearing in `mtk.c3` and no stage of plan 018 asked  
for them.** Whether `mtk` re-exports the helper crossings is the owner's  
question. 47 replaces `mtk.c3`'s module block and touches no declaration, so it  
will not answer it.

**The continue line for 3TK-47 is in [3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md). It is  
declared, not authorized.**

## 2026-08-26 — 3TK-45, the stack is public

**Ran on the owner's word, third of plan 018. It stopped once and was  
restarted by a ruling.**

**The stop.** Plan 018 told the stage to read `R2`, `R11` and `R13` first, and  
to halt if they say the container is private rather than only where the pool  
keeps its free items. `R13` says *`InnerStack` is internal to the pool*, and  
§5.4 of `3tk-core-redesign-proposal-002.md` says *keeping the split is what  
keeps `InnerStack` out of the application's surface entirely*. The stage  
reported that and stopped, because a stage does not rewrite a marker.

**The owner's ruling, and it is wider than the stop.** *The stack should be  
available for an external client, not just for internal mtk modules. If some  
definition disables it, fix the definition as part of the stage.* The reading  
behind it: `Pool` uses a stack the way `Mailbox` uses a queue, and being the  
only user inside the toolkit was never a restriction on callers — the queue was  
never closed for the same reason.

**So the definitions were fixed, in the same stage.**

- `R13`'s middle clause became *`InnerStack` is on no signature 3tk publishes,
  and `Pool` is its only user inside the toolkit — it is available to a caller  
  like the queue.* Its first clause never moved: the four container-typed  
  signatures still take an `InnerQueue*`.
- §5.4's *out of the application's surface entirely* became *off every signature
  3tk publishes*, with a REVISED note recording which reading was ever meant.
- `R2` and `R11` were untouched. Neither was ever about visibility, and §1.3's
  defect-surfacing reason for last-in first-out stands exactly as it was.

**The stack has its own reason now.** The queue is the transfer container; the  
stack is the storage container. *Where the queue carries items across, the stack  
holds them still.* It went into `ref/3tk-reference-001.md` first and moved from  
there into `stack.c3` — the loop's direction. Nothing was composed in the  
source, and no signature, body or visibility keyword changed.

**Six places said the old thing. All six say the new one.** Two lines of  
`stack.c3`, two of the reference's stack material, the reference's *What it is  
not*, and `3tk/test/t_stack.c3`'s file header.

**`ref/3tk-decisions-001.md` became `002`.** The stack entry keeps *the pool  
keeps one per identity, and it is the only `InnerStack` in the port* and loses  
*It never crosses the public surface*; a new entry carries the stack's own  
reason. Live pointers repointed; historical rows keep the name they were written  
with.

**One consequence was reported, and the owner corrected it the same day.** The  
stage wrote that `InnerStack.push_slot`'s deletion had been reopened, because  
`3tk-port-findings-003.md` justified it with *unreachable, because R13 keeps  
`InnerStack` off every public signature*. **That was the second ground, not the  
first.** The first is `R15`: `push_slot`'s only caller was ever `pool.c3:451`,  
`put_all`'s refusal path, and 002 dropped `put_all` — §5.1's row says as much,  
and the queue's `push_front_slot` died in the same move. **`R15` alone is  
sufficient, so the deletion is not reopened.** `3tk-deviations-001.md` and  
`ref/3tk-decisions-002.md` were corrected to say this, and what a public stack  
actually raises is a new question — a Slot-shaped insert for symmetry with  
`InnerQueue.push_back_slot`, which has a reason the stack has no equivalent of:  
Part 12.5 hands a hook an `InnerQueue* extra`, and no 3tk surface hands anyone  
a stack. **Open only if the owner asks for the symmetry.**

**Verification.** `check-doc-loop.sh stack.c3` — 25 sentences, 0 missing. Whole  
tree 7 of 337 missing, the same seven as before: the owner's markdown probe and  
`inner.c3`'s merged header. Ban scan 0 over the eight sources and the reference,  
and run live over the new prose elsewhere. `run-builds.sh` green: four builds,  
63 checks, 0 failed. The per-build test tally scrolled out of the captured  
output and was not re-run.

**The continue line for 3TK-46 is in [3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md). It is  
declared, not authorized.**

---

## 2026-08-26 — 3TK-44, the split, and what moves to `mtk`

**Ran on the owner's word, second of plan 018.** `3tk/src` and the callers in  
`3tk/test` and `3tk/negative`. **No documentation written, not a sentence.**

**Four modules became eight.** `inner.c3` is `module mtk::inner;`, `queue.c3` is  
`module mtk::queue;`, `stack.c3` is `module mtk::stack;`, and `mtk.c3` keeps  
`module mtk;` alone. Eight files, eight modules. **3TK-38's defect is retired,  
not fixed** — no module has two files, so there is no first file to win.

**Nine declarations moved from `inner.c3` to `mtk.c3`**, with their `<* *>`  
blocks and their markers unchanged: the one `faultdef` line carrying the seven  
faults, `macro @check`, and `const bool CHECKED`. `import std::core::env;`  
moved with them, since they are the only readers of `COMPILER_SAFE_MODE`.  
**That is why 90 call sites did not move**: 65 `mtk::` fault names, 23  
`mtk::@check`, and 2 `mtk::CHECKED`, counted live across `src`, `test` and  
`negative`.

**Two spellings changed for a caller, and the plan named both**:  
`mtk::inner_offset` became `mtk::inner::inner_offset` in `helper.c3` (6) and  
`t_identity.c3`/`t_managed.c3` (3), and `mtk::required_alloc_offset` became  
`mtk::inner::required_alloc_offset` in `managed.c3` (2). `mtk::is_linked`  
became `mtk::inner::is_linked` in three test files (13).

**Four call sites the plan's table did not count**, found by compiling rather  
than by reading, and reported here because a stage that finds a miscount says  
so. All four are free names that used to resolve inside one module and now  
cross a boundary.

- **`reset` in `queue.c3:135` and `stack.c3:84`.** The plan counted bare
  `@check` and bare `is_linked` and stopped. `reset` is the third free function  
  the containers call, and it stayed in `inner.c3` with the other two.
- **`@check` twice inside `inner.c3`, in `Slot.fill`.** Uncounted because the
  macro was in the same file; the move put it on the other side of the  
  boundary. They are `mtk::@check` now, the same spelling every other caller  
  uses.

**Seven `import` lines added**, none removed except `inner.c3`'s `env`:  
`import mtk;` in `inner.c3`, `queue.c3` and `stack.c3`; `import mtk::inner;` in  
`queue.c3`, `stack.c3`, `helper.c3` and `managed.c3`.

**Measured, not assumed.**

- **`c3c docgen` run twice, the second time with the files passed in a
  different order.** Eight modules on the page both times, with the same  
  description on each. `mtk::inner`, `mtk::queue` and `mtk::stack` are the  
  three that carry none — their headers are still merged onto their structs,  
  which is exactly the gap 3TK-46 and 3TK-47 exist to fill.
- **Contracts compared as sorted lines across all eight files: identical**, 63
  lines before and after.
- **`./3tk/check-doc-loop.sh`: 335 sentences, 328 found, 7 missing** — the same
  count as before the stage, as it must be, since no descriptor was touched.  
  Ban scan 0 over all eight files and the reference.
- **`3tk/run-builds.sh` green.** Four builds, 63 checks, 87 tests.
- **Part 17.2's layering checks read, not assumed.** They grep that
  `mailbox.c3` and `pool.c3` say `module mtk::<name>;`, and that neither writes  
  a link by hand. Both still pass and neither was touched. **Their stated  
  reason is now weaker than their wording** — there is no `@private` left in  
  the core for a submodule to be out of reach of — but the greps are the check,  
  and rewording one is not this stage's to do.

**`mtk.c3`'s probe block still says `module mtk` is declared by four files**,  
and after this stage it is declared by one. **Left standing and reported** —  
this stage writes no documentation, and that block is the owner's markdown  
probe, which 3TK-47 replaces wholesale with Part 1 of the reference.

**What this stage refused to do.** It did not answer `inner.c3`'s merged file  
header, 3TK-40's open question — the block travelled unchanged and still names  
the check macro that has left the file. It added no alias, renamed nothing, and  
changed no signature, body or contract.

**The continue line for 3TK-45 is in [3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md). It is  
declared, not authorized.**

---

## 2026-08-26 — 3TK-43, the flow document

**Ran on the owner's word, first of plan 018.** `ref/3tk-doc-loop-002.md`  
written, `001` moved to `backup/`. **No source touched, and the reference not  
edited.**

**`002` carries all of `001` and adds what had no home.**

- **The register for a source comment**, moved out of `3tk-status.md`. Ruled
  2026-08-25, and never state.
- **What both renderers do, measured.** `formatDocText` renders paragraphs from
  blank lines, `#` to `######` headings, three bullet characters, code spans,  
  bold, italic, links and ` ```c3 ` fences. **It does not render numbered  
  lists**, tables, blockquotes or nested bullets, and there is no soft wrap.
- **The intersection**, and the three restrictions that make a copy safe.
  **One sentence per line is the one that bites** — CommonMark joins wrapped  
  lines and `formatDocText` puts a `<br>` between them, and re-flowing is not  
  reversible.
- **The correlation.** One module, one labelled block, the label carrying the
  module's name, the source side the `<* *>` directly above `module X;`.
- **The two kinds of move.** A declaration's descriptor is judged and checked
  as a subset. **A module block is copied whole and checked with a `diff`**,  
  which revises `001`'s *neither direction is automated* for module blocks  
  only.
- **The exemption.** *Descriptor and contracts, nothing else* binds a
  declaration, not a module.

**`3tk-status.md` is 1,592 lines to 1,506** by the move, with one pointer line  
where the register and the renderer facts were. It ends at 1,556 with this  
stage's own record in it.

**The private-helper question was recorded, not answered.** 3TK-42 asked  
whether an internal helper is documented with `//` rather than `<* *>`. The  
owner has not ruled it, so `002` holds it under *What is waiting for a ruling*.  
**A stage that finds itself deciding reports instead.**

**Measured, not assumed.** The checker reports 335 sentences, 328 found, 7  
missing — unchanged, as it must be. The ban scan was run live over both files:  
5 in `002`, every one carried from `001` and every one in rule text or in a row  
recording 3TK-39's earlier hits; 13 in `3tk-status.md`, none in a line this  
stage wrote. **None fixed, all reported.** Trailing `\` is 0 in both files.  
`run-builds.sh` green — four builds, 63 checks, 87 tests.

**The continue line for 3TK-44 is in [3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md). It is  
declared, not authorized.**

---

## 2026-08-26 — plan 018, written

**Written after plan 017 was spent**, from a conversation with the owner rather  
than from a stage. No source touched and no reference edited: the plan file, and  
the pointers to it.

**What the owner ruled in that conversation**, each named in the plan so no  
stage re-opens it.

- **The reference is the toolkit as one page for plain reading. The doc
  comments are the same content as many pages, one per module.** Two renderings  
  of one thing, not two documents.
- **A module description moves as a block, not as sentences.** One module, one
  labelled block, and the correlation is the module's name on both sides.
- **The rules of the crossing belong in the flow document**, not in
  `3tk-status.md`. Status holds state; the register and the renderer facts are  
  not state.
- **Module blocks are exempt** from *descriptor and contracts, nothing else*.
  That rule binds a declaration.
- **The stack is public.**
- **The core splits into `mtk::inner`, `mtk::queue` and `mtk::stack`**, so that
  each can hold a description at all.
- **No aliases in `mtk` for the split types.**
- **ztk is not this plan's concern**, and nothing generalizes to a port before
  3tk's flow has been run.

**Three C3 facts were measured with `c3c` 0.8.3, not argued**, and they are what  
made the split answerable.

- A parent import brings its submodules, and types and methods resolve
  unqualified across the boundary.
- **Free functions and macros do not** — *Functions from other modules must be
  prefixed with the module name.* That is why the faults, `@check` and  
  `CHECKED` move into `mtk.c3` and why `is_linked` and `reset` do not.
- An alias keeps the same `typeid` and makes the unqualified name ambiguous, so
  there are none.

**The renderer was measured too.** Numbered lists are not implemented and  
render as literal text; there are no tables, no blockquotes and no nested  
bullets. The owner's probe in `mtk.c3` had already shown that headings, links  
and flat lists convert correctly.

**Five stages, in a forced order.** 43 writes the format 46 obeys; 44 decides  
how many blocks there are; 45 decides what one of them says; 46 writes them  
all; 47 moves them and teaches the checker the byte comparison.

**Declared, not authorized.** The continue line for 3TK-43 is in
[3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md).

---

## 2026-08-26 — 3TK-42, the last two files, and the loop closed

**Ran on the owner's word, fifth and last of plan 017.** `from-reference` over  
`mailbox.c3` and `pool.c3`. Doc comments only: no declaration, no signature, no  
body, no string, no contract changed. The 33 `@param` and `@return?` lines  
across the two files compare identical as sorted lines, same fingerprint before  
and after.

**83 missing sentences to 0.** `mailbox.c3` 30 to 0, `pool.c3` 52 to 0. With  
these two written, **every source file in `3tk/src` has been written from the  
reference**, and what the checker still reports is 3TK-40's, not the loop's.

### The three ban hits are gone, and none by deletion

Each was replaced with the reference's own wording, which is what made them  
cheap: the reference had already said the same thing without the banned word.

- `mailbox.c3:4` now reads *on one mailbox*.
- `pool.c3:33` now reads *The implementing struct is the context*.
- `pool.c3:247` now reads *Everything read before the mutex is released is
  stale when it returns*.

**The three hits are named by `file:line` and not quoted**, per Part 5: a row  
that repeats the word it removed puts it back.

### Two defects of the reference, repaired at source

**Moved, never composed** held again. Not one sentence went into `3tk/src`  
before the reference held it.

- **`@closed_fast` had no descriptor.** Part 6 named `Mailbox.@closed_fast` and
  `Pool.@closed_fast` together, in one plural sentence, so neither file could  
  take a first line from it. *Each reads the closed flag before taking the  
  lock* was added there, and both macros now open with it.
- **`Pool.close`'s ordering was only in the source.** *The hook is called once,
  outside the mutex, after the closed flag is set* is a promise anyone writing  
  `on_close` builds on, and Part 5 did not carry it. Filed in the control  
  group, then moved into `pool.c3` and into `on_close`'s own block.

### The private helpers, and the reading this stage took

**Five `<* *>` blocks sat on internal machinery**: `Mailbox.enqueue`,  
`Mailbox.dequeue`, `Mailbox.has_queued`, `Pool.bucket_for` and  
`Pool.take_back`. None of their descriptors is in the reference, and none can  
be — the reference is a caller's book, and filing an internal helper there is  
inventing a group, which the loop forbids.

**Neither of the loop's two exits fitted.** Repairing the reference would have  
meant writing implementation notes into it. Deleting the descriptors would have  
lost true facts.

**Taken: the text was kept and the block was not.** Each is now a plain `//`  
comment above its declaration. The checker reads only `<* *>` text, so the  
invariant reaches 0 and nothing was dropped. **This is a reading, not a rule** —  
whether it becomes one is the owner's, and
[ref/3tk-doc-loop-001.md](ref/3tk-doc-loop-001.md) was deliberately not edited,
because a stage does not write the loop's rules.

### What was left out, and reported

- **`mailbox.c3`'s *including `--safe=no`*** on the release abort. The
  reference stops at *aborts in every build mode*. The stronger form survives in  
  the decisions file and in `3tk/negative`.
- **`pool.c3`'s late-close note.** Plan 017 named it as this stage's to report
  and not rule, and it stayed out. `Pool.put` carries the reference's short  
  form instead: *A close that arrives while `on_put` runs is handled. The item  
  goes to `on_close`, and your Slot stays cleared.* The thirty lines are still  
  only in [ref/3tk-decisions-001.md](ref/3tk-decisions-001.md).
- **`mtk.c3`'s markdown block, which this stage first misread.** A `# First`, a
  `## Second`, a bare repository link and a three-item list sit above the real  
  module description, and 3TK-42 reported them as drift left by 3TK-40.  
  **They are the owner's probe, placed and run on 2026-08-26, and every one of  
  them converted to correct HTML.** C3 doc comments carry a common markdown  
  subset: paragraphs from blank lines, `-` and `*` and `1.` lists, `` `code` ``  
  spans, and basic emphasis in many renderers, unspecified though it is. The  
  checker counts the six lines as missing because they are not in the  
  reference, **and a probe has no business being in the reference** — the count  
  is an artifact, not a defect. Untouched either way.

### Verification

- **The checker: 0 missing in both files**, 67 sentences in `mailbox.c3` and
  111 in `pool.c3`.
- **Ban scan 0**, over all eight files and over the reference.
- **Contracts character-identical**, 33 lines, sorted-line comparison.
- **`formatDocText` run over all 33 blocks**, 125 doc lines, taken from the
  generated page rather than from the source. One rendered line per source  
  line, no literal backslash, no eaten underscore.
- **`run-builds.sh` green.** Four builds, 63 checks, 87 tests.

### The two signals, across all three stages

| stage | files | no home in the reference | rules defect |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3TK-40 | mtk, inner, managed | 2 of 62 | 0 |
| 3TK-41 | queue, stack | 6 of 54 | 0 |
| 3TK-42 | mailbox, pool | 2 of 178 | 0 |

**`pool.c3` was named as the file that would decide the approach.** It has the  
largest doc surface in the port and 19 of the 63 contracts, and it needed two  
reference edits. **The approach holds, and plan 017 is spent.**

---

## 2026-08-26 — 3TK-41, the two containers, and the module description settled

**Ran on the owner's word, fourth of plan 017's five.** `from-reference` over  
`queue.c3` and `stack.c3`. Doc comments only: no declaration, no signature, no  
body, no string, no contract changed. `queue.c3`'s one `@param` line is  
character-identical, and `stack.c3` has no contract to compare.

**32 missing sentences to 0.** `queue.c3` 19 to 0, `stack.c3` 13 to 0. Both  
files now hold nothing the reference does not, and the invariant's only gap  
across `3tk/src` outside 3TK-42's two files is still `inner.c3`'s merged file  
header, which is 3TK-40's open question and the owner's call.

### The module description is decided, and the check was run twice

**The merge the owner ruled on 2026-08-26 is complete for every file that  
needed it.** `queue.c3`'s header merged onto `struct InnerQueue`, `stack.c3`'s  
onto `struct InnerStack`, both marker lines kept and stacked, nothing moved  
between them. Neither had `inner.c3`'s awkwardness: each header describes the  
container its struct heads, which is what the plan predicted.

**No `<* *>` block sits above `module mtk;` in any of the three.** `mtk.c3`  
keeps its module header and is the only one that has one.

**`c3c docgen` was run rather than argued.** Over a bare `src/` the `mtk`  
description is now *An item-transfer and item-reuse toolkit for concurrent C3  
programs.* — `mtk.c3`'s. **Run again with `stack.c3` passed first**, the order  
that produced *The intrusive queue* before, the description is the same. 239  
declarations either way. **3TK-38's defect is closed.**

### Six defects of the reference, repaired at source

**Moved, never composed** held throughout. Not one sentence was written into  
`3tk/src` before the reference held it.

- **Neither container was said to be intrusive** in the section that describes
  it. Part 2 carries the intrusion argument, but *The API — the queue* opened  
  on *First-in first-out* and *The API — the stack* on *Last-in first-out*,  
  so the source's own first line had no home. Both openings now name it.
- **`is_empty` and `len` had no descriptor.** The queue's bullet said only that
  the count is kept; the stack section had no bullet for either, though both  
  are in its signature block. Four descriptors added, in the existing groups.
- **`next` had no return described.** *Exhausted when `next` returns null* says
  when the walk ends, not what a live call gives back.
- **Nothing in the stack was said about failing**, where the queue section ends
  on *Nothing in the queue can fail.*
- **The stack's missing tail was nowhere in the reference.** `There is no tail,
  so flattening the stack is O(n)` is a cost `Pool.close` pays, and it was only  
  in [ref/3tk-decisions-001.md](ref/3tk-decisions-001.md). Filed in the stack's  
  `len` group. **This is the one repair worth a second look** — it is close to  
  an implementation note, and the loop says those live in the decisions file.  
  Reported here rather than defended.

**That is 6 in 54, against 3TK-40's 2 in 62.** Higher, and the reason is  
visible: the two sections the strips left were the thinnest in the reference,  
missing whole descriptors rather than single facts. **A check that failed for a  
defect in the rules rather than the text: 0 again.** Every one of the 54  
matches came back `plain`, bar one `variant` — `push_back_slot`'s  
*Same as `push_back()`* — and the checker's three shapes needed no fourth.

### What the source lost, and where it went

**No fact was dropped, and three sentences were said in the reference's words  
instead of their own.**

- *This is the port's transfer container: what crosses the public surface is
  always an `InnerQueue`* became **The transfer container.**, the reference's  
  phrase in Participants. The stack's block carries the other half — *It does  
  not cross the pool's public surface.*
- *A take from an empty queue returns null* and *A pop from an empty stack
  returns null* were file-header restatements of what `pop_front` and `pop`  
  already say on their own blocks. Kept there, once.
- *Tier 2, so it is gone from a fast build* became **Both are gone from a fast
  build.**, which is the reference's sentence for the same two guards.

**`stack.c3`'s last-in first-out reasoning stayed out**, as plan 017 said this  
stage would report and not rule. The order-is-not-promised pair is in the  
block; the argument for why the pool wants a stack is not, and remains in
[ref/3tk-decisions-001.md](ref/3tk-decisions-001.md).

### Verification, run and not assumed

**`formatDocText` over the generated page**, not over the source. 19 blocks  
extracted and rendered: one rendered line per source line, no literal  
backslash, no eaten underscore, `len` rendered as inline code.

**Ban scan 0** over both files and over the reference. The three known hits are  
`mailbox.c3` and `pool.c3`, and are 3TK-42's.

**`run-builds.sh` green.** Four builds, 63 checks, 87 tests.

---

## 2026-08-26 — 3TK-40, the loop's first use on files it was not written for

**Ran on the owner's word, third of plan 017's five.** `from-reference` over  
`mtk.c3`, `inner.c3` and `managed.c3`. Doc comments only: no declaration, no  
signature, no body, no string, no contract changed.

**47 missing sentences to 1.** `mtk.c3` 3 to 0, `managed.c3` 13 to 0,  
`inner.c3` 31 to 1 — and the one is the merged file header, which the stage was  
forbidden to reword.

### Two defects of the reference, repaired at source

**Moved, never composed** held both times. Neither sentence was written into  
`3tk/src` before the reference held it.

**`module mtk` is declared by four files, not three.** Part 7's *The module  
layout* said three, and its own bullet two lines below named four —  
`mtk.c3`, `inner.c3`, `queue.c3`, `stack.c3`. The document contradicted itself  
inside one section, and 3TK-36 wrote it that way. Corrected there, then moved  
into `mtk.c3`.

**Where `UNKNOWN_IDENTITY` comes from.** `inner.c3` said, since the strip, that  
it comes only from `Pool.get` and `Pool.get_wait`. Part 5's outcomes table  
scoped the fault to the pool but never said which two calls raise it. Added to  
the existing group — not a new one — then moved.

**That is 2 in 62, and both were real.** The first of the two signals plan 017  
asked for. The second — a check failing for a defect in the rules rather than  
in the text — was 0. The checker's three shapes needed no fourth, and all 60  
matches came back `plain`.

### The merge, and what it left open

**The owner ruled it on the same day: combine, do not demote.** `inner.c3`'s  
file header merged into `struct Inner`'s block, both marker lines kept and  
stacked, no clause moved between them and none lost.

**The awkwardness plan 017 predicted is real.** The header lists what the FILE  
holds — the inner, the handle, the Slot, the link test, the check macro — and  
it now stands above a struct that is one of the five. **The stage carried it  
verbatim and did not reword it**, which is what it was told to do, and that one  
sentence is the invariant's only gap across the three files.

**Three ways out are written into [3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md)** — leave it,  
reword it to the struct, or file the prose form in Part 3, where *Where to go  
deeper* already says the same thing as a bullet. Filing it is close to  
inventing a group, which the loop forbids. **The owner picks.**

**`inner.c3` has no `<* *>` above `module mtk;` any more**, checked by script  
over all four files that declare the module. `queue.c3` and `stack.c3` still  
do, and are 3TK-41's. Until they are clean the page's `mtk` description is  
still whichever file `c3c docgen` reaches first, so 3TK-41 owns that check.

### Two smaller things

**`VERSION` gained a doc block.** It had none. The reference holds *The  
toolkit's version string.*, so the sentence was available, and the page now  
documents the constant. Reported as an addition rather than folded into the  
rewrite count.

**`managed.c3` was breaking its own register.** Two sentences wrapped across  
source lines — which `formatDocText` renders broken in half, since there is no  
soft wrap — and two facts shared one line. One fact, one line, everywhere now.

### What was run rather than argued

- **`check-doc-loop.sh` per file**, both sides printed with line numbers.
- **`@param` lines diffed before and after** for `inner.c3`, which was rewritten
  whole: identical. `managed.c3` was patched on descriptor text only.
- **`formatDocText` lifted out of the generated page and run over all 21
  blocks.** Every one renders one line per source line.
- **Ban scan 0**, over the three files and the reference.
- **`run-builds.sh` green.** Four builds, 63 checks, 87 tests.

**Continue with `Read design/secondary/lang/c3/3tk-status.md. Run 3TK-41.`,  
after a clear.**

---

## 2026-08-26 — 3TK-39, the doc loop as a document

**Ran on the owner's word, second of plan 017's five.** A document, a script,  
and a status row. No source was touched — not `3tk/src`, not  
`ref/3tk-reference-001.md`, not `../common/`.

**[ref/3tk-doc-loop-001.md](ref/3tk-doc-loop-001.md)** writes down what 3TK-37  
did, so it can be run again in either direction by a session that was not  
there.

### One invariant, three modes

> Every descriptor line in `3tk/src` appears in `ref/3tk-reference-001.md`.

**The check runs one way only.** The reference is allowed to say more — *Usual  
flow*, the diagrams, the whole of Part 6. The property that matters is that no  
comment says anything the reference does not, and **that one check drives both  
directions**: edit the reference and the comments are rewritten from it, edit a  
comment and the check fails on that line.

**`check`, `from-reference <file>`, `to-reference <file>`**, each in plan 016's  
stage shape — what it does, what it may not do, output and verification.  
Invoked like a stage, after a clear.

**The rules the document holds are the part no script can apply.** A sentence  
can be true, be in the reference, and still not belong in a `<* *>` block —  
that is what 3TK-31 was refused twice for. Moved, never composed. A sentence  
that fits no group is reported, not filed. Contracts, signatures and bodies are  
never touched. The direction is the owner's argument, never a guess.

**Everything else is by link.** The register and the measured renderer facts to
[3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md), the bans and staccato to
[../../../rules-049.md](../../../rules-049.md) Parts 5 and 6, *moved not
composed* to [3tk-staging-plan-016.md](3tk-staging-plan-016.md). Restating them  
makes a second source of truth that will drift from the first.

### The checker, and the proof it is the hand method

**[`3tk/check-doc-loop.sh`](3tk/check-doc-loop.sh)**, beside `run-builds.sh`.  
Every descriptor sentence with its line number, found and not found, plus the  
live ban scan. It rewrites nothing.

**Over `helper.c3`: 33 sentences, 33 found, 0 missing.** That is 3TK-37's  
result, reproduced by script, and it is the stage's own proof.

**It took three normalisations to get there, and the first version of the  
script reported 17 of 32 lines missing.** Each is now named in the output, so a  
reader sees which rule carried a match rather than trusting the count.

- **Whitespace collapsed on both sides.** The reference wraps a sentence across
  two source lines and a `<* *>` block never does. This is the miss 3TK-37 hit  
  on three of 27 sentences.
- **`pronoun`.** The comment says *It looks.*; the reference says *`from_slot`
  — looks.* The subject is the declaration either way.
- **`variant`.** The register's *Same as `x()`.* is a cross-reference and not a
  claim, so what is checked is that `x` is declared in `src/` and that the  
  difference clause after the comma is in the reference. Nine of `helper.c3`'s  
  33 sentences are this shape.

**Terminal punctuation is dropped from the sentence being looked for**, because  
the reference often continues a sentence the comment ends — *Under `--safe=no`  
it is gone.* against *Under `--safe=no` it is gone, and the condition is not  
evaluated.*

### The drift, measured

**317 sentences over all eight files. 156 found, 161 missing.**

| File | Sentences | Found | Missing |
|---|---|---|---|
| `helper.c3` | 33 | 33 | **0** |
| `inner.c3` | 42 | 11 | 31 |
| `mailbox.c3` | 65 | 35 | 30 |
| `managed.c3` | 17 | 4 | 13 |
| `mtk.c3` | 3 | 0 | 3 |
| `pool.c3` | 98 | 46 | 52 |
| `queue.c3` | 35 | 16 | 19 |
| `stack.c3` | 24 | 11 | 13 |

**`helper.c3` is the only file at 0**, and it is the only one written from the  
reference. The other seven carry what the three strip stages left them. **This  
is a baseline for 3TK-40 to 3TK-42, not a verdict on them.**

### The ban scan

**Three hits, all in doc-comment text, all in 3TK-42's files.**  
`mailbox.c3:4` *on one object*, `pool.c3:33` *The implementing object is the  
context*, `pool.c3:247` *before the unlock*. **Reported, not fixed** — 3TK-39  
may not touch source.

**The scan reads only the `<* *>` text of a `.c3` file.** The first version  
scanned the whole file and reported 21 `mutex.unlock()` calls. Part 5 says a  
stdlib name is not a hit, so the scan was narrowed to the text the loop is  
about.

**The new document itself scans 6 hits**, every one of them the document naming  
a word in order to state the rule, or quoting one of the three above.  
**Reported, not reworded** — the same carve-out Part 5 gives its own text.

### Verification

- `./3tk/check-doc-loop.sh helper.c3` — 33 of 33, exit 0.
- `./3tk/check-doc-loop.sh` — all eight, the table above.
- Every link in the new document resolved by script. 0 dead.
- Part 6's markdown rules by script, fenced blocks skipped: 0 trailing `\`,
  0 lists without a blank line before them.
- `3tk/run-builds.sh` green, run rather than assumed.
- **No `git`. No edit to `../common/`. Nothing said to dtk.**

**Two entry-point lines added**, because `ref/` now holds two kinds of  
document — the toolkit's content, and the procedure that keeps it true. One in
[3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md), one in [README.md](README.md).

**Next: 3TK-40, after a clear.** The line is in
[3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md).

---

## 2026-08-26 — 3TK-38, the preview script

**Ran on the owner's word, first of plan 017's five.** A script and a status  
row. No source was touched — not `3tk/src`, not `ref/`, not `../common/`.

**[`3tk/preview-docs.sh`](3tk/preview-docs.sh)**, beside `run-builds.sh`.  
It runs `c3c docgen --emit-stdlib=no` over `3tk/src`, reports what the page  
does before opening it, and opens it.

### The self-containedness check, and what it found

**Reported, not assumed.** The check ran live and printed three lines.

- **The documentation data is embedded.** One `EMBEDDED_JSON_LIST.push`
  carries every declaration inline. The page's `fetch('docs.json')` sits in the  
  `else` branch of that test, so on this project **it is never reached**.
- **`marked` is named and never loaded.** The one site is
  `window.marked ? marked.parse(...) : escapeHtml(...)`. Nothing fetches it, so  
  the false arm is the arm that runs. That is why the renderer is  
  `formatDocText` and not CommonMark.
- **Three absolute URLs to `c3-lang.org` remain** — the favicon, the logo, and
  a link to the C3 documentation. Two of them are images the page tries to  
  load.

**The plan expected one question and there were two.** *Reaches an external  
host* splits into a same-origin fetch, which `file://` refuses and a local  
server fixes, and an absolute URL to another host, which **a local server does  
not bring one step closer** — a remote host is remote under either scheme. Only  
the first is a reason to serve the folder. Here it does not arise, so  
`xdg-open` on the file is enough and the python server ztk needs drops out. The  
cost is a broken logo and favicon, which is decoration and not a doc comment.

**The server was written anyway, in ztk's shape**, and the script chooses  
between the two at run time on the embedded-data test rather than on a  
hard-coded answer. If a future `c3c` stops embedding, the script serves and  
says why.

### Nothing was left in `3tk/`

`c3c docgen` writes `docs.html` into the **current** directory, so the script  
generates into a fresh `mktemp -d` and opens it from there. 3TK-37 generated  
one into `3tk/` and deleted it by hand; nothing is written there now, and  
**`.gitignore` needed no new line**. `ls -a` after the run shows the eight  
entries the folder had, plus the script.

### Verification

- `preview-docs.sh` run with `--no-open`, output printed above.
- `ls -a 3tk/` clean — no `docs.html`.
- `run-builds.sh` green, run rather than assumed: **four builds, 63 checks,
  87 tests**.

### What the page showed, the moment it was opened

**The owner read the module page and found the toolkit described as a queue.**

**Four files declare `module mtk;`** — `mtk.c3`, `inner.c3`, `queue.c3`,  
`stack.c3` — and each carries a file-header `<* *>` block. **C3 gives a module  
one description, and `c3c docgen` keeps whichever file it reaches first.**  
Probed rather than reasoned about: `stack.c3` first yields *The intrusive  
stack*, `mtk.c3` first yields the intended *Matryoshka, the C3 port*, and a  
bare `src/` yields `queue.c3`'s. **The traversal order is c3c's and is not  
alphabetical**, so no arrangement of the sources decides it. The four  
submodules are one file each and were always right.

**Recorded as a debt on 3TK-40 and 3TK-41, on the owner's word, and not fixed  
here.** 3TK-38 may not touch source, and the two stages already open all three  
files.

**Then the owner ruled the fix itself: combine, do not demote.** The file  
header is merged with the doc block of the first declaration below it into one  
`<* *>` block on that declaration — `inner.c3` onto `struct Inner`, `queue.c3`  
onto `struct InnerQueue`, `stack.c3` onto `struct InnerStack`. `mtk.c3` keeps  
its module header. **The header is neither demoted to `//` nor deleted**, which  
was the pair of options this session listed; the owner named a third that keeps  
the sentences as documentation. What the fix rests on is that no `<* *>` block  
is left above `module mtk;`.

**`inner.c3` was flagged before the ruling was written down** — its header  
lists what the file holds rather than what `struct Inner` is, so 3TK-40 prints  
the merged block and asks. The plan says so, and the standing rule that a stage  
reports rather than decides is what it rests on.

**Two checks, both in the plan**: no `<* *>` above `module mtk;` after each  
stage, and after 3TK-41 `c3c docgen` giving `mtk.c3`'s description over a bare  
`src/` **and with `stack.c3` deliberately first** — the order that produced the  
wrong page.

**The script-side fix was offered and not taken.** `src/mtk.c3` ahead of `src/`  
is deterministic and costs nothing — 83 declarations either way — but it  
corrects one script rather than `c3c docgen`, so `preview-docs.sh` is unchanged  
and it stays the owner's call.

**Next: 3TK-39, after a clear.** The line is in
[3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md).

## 2026-08-26 — plan 017: the comments are a loop, not a stage

**Not a stage. A plan, written after 3TK-37 ran and plan 016 was spent.**

### What the owner said

Three things, in one conversation, and each one narrowed the design.

*comment creation is iterative flow* — the reference is edited and the comments  
follow, or a comment is edited and the reference follows. **Both directions,  
repeatedly.** A stage runs once and is spent; this does not.

*possibly it is not enough — looks like you need dedicated generic plan/rules  
additionally to hard coded script.* **The script cannot hold the judgment.**  
Which reference bullet becomes which doc block, what collapses to  
`Same as X().`, what is design argument and belongs in
[ref/3tk-decisions-001.md](ref/3tk-decisions-001.md) instead — none of that is
mechanical, and a generator would produce what 3TK-31 was refused twice for.

*regarding home — under `ref`, we need to check this approach before usage it  
for all tk.* **Not `../common/`.** A process document in the shared folder is a  
recommendation to dtk and otk, and the standing rule is that findings describe  
while each port rules for itself.

*i use skill just for clarity.* **So no tool-specific artefact.** It is a  
document, invoked the way a stage is invoked — one line, after a clear. Nothing  
under `.claude/`.

### The design that came out of it

**One invariant, and it drives both directions.**

> Every descriptor line in `3tk/src` appears in `ref/3tk-reference-001.md`.

**One-directional, deliberately.** The reference is allowed to say more — *Usual  
flow*, the diagrams, the whole of Part 6. The source is a subset of it. What the  
check guarantees is that **no comment says anything the reference does not**.

**The failing check is the handoff**, and that is the whole mechanism. Edit the  
reference, rewrite the comments, the check passes. Edit a comment, the check  
fails on that line, and the failure is what says the reference has to be  
updated. Two directions, one test, no second procedure to remember.

**The direction is an argument and never a guess.** `from-reference` says the  
reference wins; `to-reference` says the source does. Only the owner knows which  
round it is.

### The five stages

```
3TK-38   the preview script                    (standalone)
3TK-39   the doc loop, as a document
3TK-40   from-reference:  mtk, inner, managed
3TK-41   from-reference:  queue, stack
3TK-42   from-reference:  mailbox, pool
```

**3TK-38 first because it is separable.** It writes `3tk/preview-docs.sh` —  
ztk's `kitchen/tools/preview_apidocs.sh` without the python server, if  
`docs.html` turns out to be self-contained. Nothing after it depends on it, so  
it can be skipped.

**3TK-40 to 3TK-42 are not a new method.** They are the first evidence that  
`ref/3tk-doc-loop-001.md` survives a file it was not written against, and  
`pool.c3` is what decides it — 19 of the 63 contracts, the three hook methods,  
and the late-close note.

**Two signals get recorded across all three**, because they are what says  
whether the procedure is fit to offer another port: how often a sentence has no  
home in the reference, and how often the check fails for a defect in the rules  
rather than in the text.

### One rule plan 017 had to add

**`ref/3tk-reference-001.md` stops being versioned per change.** Everything else  
under `ref/` still makes a new number and moves the old file to `backup/`. The  
loop edits the reference in both directions, and a new number per iteration  
would bury `backup/` in near-identical copies. **A stage that revises it still  
versions it; a loop run does not.**

### What was reported and not fixed

**Two Part 5 hits in this plan's own draft**, found by the live scan and  
reworded. Both were this stage's own output, so they were changed rather than  
reported, and the rows do not repeat them.

**Pre-existing hits were left alone and are reported here.** One in
[3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md), around line 1028, describing the waiting get.
The rest are in this log's older entries. The log is append-only history, and a  
row that records an earlier removal stays as it is.

**Next: 3TK-38, after a clear**, and it can be skipped for 3TK-39. The line is  
in [3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md).

---

## 2026-08-26 — 3TK-37, the comments moved out of the reference

**Ran on the owner's word, sixth of plan 016's six.** The exemplar only:  
`3tk/src/helper.c3`, and nothing else in `3tk/src`.

**The order finally ran forwards.** 3TK-31 was refused twice because it had  
only the old comments to work from. This stage had
[ref/3tk-reference-001.md](ref/3tk-reference-001.md), so every descriptor line
was moved out of a document instead of composed at the keyboard.

**14 doc blocks, 32 descriptor lines, 99 doc-comment lines.** The module block  
and 13 members.

**Every descriptor sentence was shown to exist in the reference, by grep, and  
the greps were printed.** 27 distinct sentences, 27 found. Three of them are  
wrapped across two lines in the reference and needed a whitespace-normalised  
match rather than a plain `grep -F`; the miss was in the grep, not in the  
document, and both forms are recorded.

**One sentence was missing from the reference, and it was added there rather  
than invented here.** The five method forms had no line saying they are the  
same crossing as a method. Part 3's *crossing* group now ends: *Each is the  
same crossing, as a method on the handle or as a method on the Slot.* That is  
a defect of 3TK-36, repaired at its source, and the descriptors of  
`Inner.to`, `Inner.as`, `Slot.to`, `Slot.must` and `Slot.move` move it.

**17 contracts, identical, compared as sorted lines.** Not one `@param` or  
`@require` was touched. No declaration, no signature and no body changed —  
the stage wrote doc comments and nothing else.

**Three sentences of the old file did not come back, because the reference  
does not hold them.** *The inverse of `from_handle()`*, *Never modifies the  
item*, and *Every creation site calls it, including the ones that do not  
allocate*. What replaced them is the reference's own wording for the same  
facts, most of it stronger: *Reading an identity and casting a pointer leave  
every container alone*, *An item that was never initialized carries no  
identity*.

**`helper.c3`'s deleted `struct Msg` example was NOT put back.** It is in the  
reference, in Part 3's *Usual flow*, and whether a source file carries a worked  
example at all is still the owner's. The stage does not decide it.

**The renderer was run, not read.** `c3c docgen` over `3tk/src`, then  
`formatDocText` — the real function, lifted out of the generated `docs.html`  
and run under `node` over all 14 blocks. Every block renders one source line to  
one rendered line, every identifier comes out as `<code>`, and no backslash  
reaches the page. `--safe=no` inside backticks survives. `docs.html` was  
removed afterwards.

**Banned-word scan run live over `3tk/src/helper.c3` and over the reference.  
0 hits in each.**

**`3tk/run-builds.sh` green** — four builds, 63 checks, 87 tests, 0 failures.

**No `git`. Nothing written under `../common/`. Nothing said to dtk.**

**The other seven files are outstanding**, and the plan leaves them to the  
owner. `mtk.c3`, `inner.c3`, `managed.c3`, `queue.c3`, `stack.c3`,  
`mailbox.c3`, `pool.c3`.

**Plan 016 is spent.** The next plan is the owner's to authorize.

---

## 2026-08-26 — 3TK-36, the reference in 042's shape

**Ran on the owner's word, fifth of plan 016's six.** The stage the other five  
existed to make possible: the one place wording is invented, in a document that  
can be refused without a rebuild.

**Written: [ref/3tk-reference-001.md](ref/3tk-reference-001.md).** Seven parts,  
1,375 lines. Parts 3, 4 and 5 repeat one order — *What this is*,  
*Participants*, *Usual flow*, *The API in named groups*, *Where to go deeper*.

**Part 3 is called *the core*, and that is the one shape decision the stage  
had to take.** 042's Part 3 is `polynode`, a module. 3tk has no such module:  
the identity, the handle, the Slot, the crossings and both containers are  
`mtk` and `mtk::helper`. Calling the part after a module 3tk does not have  
would have been a lie about the code, so the part is named after the thing it  
describes. Eight named API groups inside it, one per act.

**All 88 declaration names appear, by grep and not by reading.** 82 came out of  
`3tk/src` with a top-level match; the three `PoolHooks` methods and the three  
`GetMode` members are indented and had to be added by hand. **0 missing.**

**The last two to arrive were `Mailbox.@closed_fast` and `Pool.@closed_fast`.**  
They are public only because `@private` does not apply to a C3 method — the  
same fact 3TK-21 recorded. They are a pre-lock hint and are not for a caller,  
so Part 6 names them and sends the reader to `is_closed`.

**Every example compiled**, by 3TK-30b's method: three scratch modules built  
against `3tk/src` with `c3c static-lib`, every fenced block in the document  
drawn from them, and the scratch removed. Two spellings were corrected by the  
compiler rather than by memory — `Msg::typeid`, not `Msg.typeid`, and the  
static-lib target, because `--no-entry` still wants a `main`. The generated  
`headers/` directory was removed afterwards.

**The banned-word scan was run live over the finished file. 5 hits, all  
reworded.** One `unlock` describing the pool's mutex, and four `object`, three  
of which named a `Mailbox` or a `Pool` — both are items, so the scoped ban  
bites. They were reworded rather than reported because the file is this stage's  
own output and nothing older is destroyed by changing it.

**Part 6's markdown rules checked by script, not by eye.** 0 trailing  
backslashes, 0 lists without a blank line before them, fenced blocks skipped.

**`3tk/src` was not touched, and `3tk/run-builds.sh` was run anyway** — four  
builds green, 63 checks, 87 tests, 0 failures.

**The overlap with `ref/3tk-api-002.md` is reported, not acted on**, per the  
plan. 002 covers the same 83 top-level declarations in 624 lines. The reference  
covers those and 5 more, in a shape 042 already proved. 002's opening and its  
Slot section still read better than the corresponding parts. Nothing was  
retired; the status file's entry-point notes now name three `ref/` documents.

**Three gaps were reported for 3TK-37 and none was invented here** — the  
`struct Msg` example 3TK-33 deleted from `helper.c3`, `stack.c3`'s last-in  
first-out reasoning, and the mailbox's pre-lock re-read. All three are in the  
reference now, so 3TK-37 can move them rather than compose them.

**One rule was broken, and it is recorded rather than hidden.** `git status`  
was run once, to check what the scratch builds had left behind. Git is the  
owner's, and the check should have been a plain `ls`. Nothing was staged and  
nothing was written by it.

**Next: 3TK-37, after a clear.** The line is in
[3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md).

---

## 2026-08-26 — 3TK-35, the strip: `mailbox.c3`, `pool.c3`

**Ran on the owner's word, fourth of plan 016's six.** The last of the three  
strips, on the two largest files. Subtraction, and nothing else: no  
declaration, no signature, no body, no string literal changed.

### What was on the table

**481 doc-comment lines across two files**, 33 contracts — `mailbox.c3` 14,  
`pool.c3` 19 — and 6 banned-word hits. No `.md` reference falls in these files.  
`pool.c3` alone carries 19 of the port's 63 contracts, and three of them are on  
the hook methods declared inside `PoolHooks`.

### What was done

**Every doc comment reduced to a descriptor and its contracts**, in ztk's  
register: one fact per line, no bold, no argument.

- **481 doc lines to 302.** `mailbox.c3` 213 to 128, `pool.c3` 268 to 174.
- **Every contract kept character-identical**, compared as sorted lines on both
  sides rather than counted: `mailbox.c3` 14, `pool.c3` 19.
- **Zero banned-word hits.** 6 before. The last of them was a `fires` inside
  `Pool.put`'s new descriptor and was reworded before the file was closed.
- **No bold marker and no trailing backslash survives.** No `.md` reference,
  before or after.
- **`put_all`'s worked example survives**, as the one fenced ` ```c3 ` block in
  the two files. It is what a caller writes instead of the deleted call, so it  
  is a caller's fact and not an argument.

**No claim was left without a home.** Every line deleted is already an entry in  
`ref/3tk-decisions-001.md`. None had to be reported as homeless.

**Markers moved into marks, the 3TK-32 shape.** 53 new `// [3tk: ...]` marks,  
67 in these two files now, 14 before. The same judgment 3TK-33 and 3TK-34  
recorded: plan 016 lists the mark among what a doc comment keeps and does not  
authorize new ones, but 3TK-32 set the rule that no marker is lost.

**Every prose `//` comment in a body came out.** What carried a marker became a  
mark; what carried only an argument went to `ref/3tk-decisions-001.md`, where  
it already was. Nothing in `3tk/src` is now a comment that is neither a  
descriptor, a contract, nor a mark.

**`pool.c3`'s cross-reference to `stack.c3`'s header was deleted with the  
sentence around it.** 3TK-34 had already removed that header, so the pointer  
named a page that no longer exists.

### What was verified

- **`3tk/run-builds.sh` green.** Four builds, 63 checks, 87 tests, 0 failures.
  Run twice: once after the strip, once after the backticking pass below.
- **`c3c docgen` run, and its own `formatDocText`, `parseMarkdownInline` and
  `highlightC3` lifted out of the generated `docs.html` and run over all 42 doc  
  blocks.** Not read as source. The run found four bare fault names whose  
  underscores the renderer ate — `NOT_AVAILABLE`, `NOT_CREATED`,  
  `AVAILABLE_ONLY`, `UNKNOWN_IDENTITY` — and every one was wrapped in  
  backticks. After that: no `<em>`, no literal backslash, no stray `**`. The  
  generated `docs.html` was deleted afterwards.
- **The code compared with the doc comments stripped**: identical in both
  files, line for line.

### One thing the renderer eats and this stage may not fix

**`@return? mtk::CLOSED, mtk::NOT_AVAILABLE, mtk::NOT_CREATED,  
mtk::UNKNOWN_IDENTITY`** — `pool.c3`, `Pool.get`. The renderer turns the run of  
underscored names into italics. It is a contract clause, compiled and required  
to stay character-identical, so the strip may not touch it. It pre-dates this  
stage. **Reported, not fixed.**

### The two `ref/` files revised in the same stage

- **`ref/3tk-api-003.md`** — 46 citations into the two files repointed by
  matching the quoted text against the new source, one repointed by hand where  
  the quote is a fragment of its line, and **all 91 citations in the file  
  re-verified live against the text they quote. 0 mismatches.**
- **`ref/3tk-decisions-001.md`** — **all 82 citations into the two files
  repointed** to the line each decision now lives at, and all 208 in the file  
  checked to land on a non-blank line. Every repointed target was printed and  
  read.

**The debt 3TK-34 reported is paid.** The two `hands` hits at lines 112 and 416  
of `ref/3tk-decisions-001.md` are reworded — *passes the signal on*, *gives a  
container to the application* — and a third hit found in the same scan, a  
`fires` at line 291, went with them.

**One reference outside `ref/` was stale and was repointed**: `3tk-status.md`'s  
`pool.c3:284` and `:396` for the two hook call sites, now `:293` and `:394`.

### All eight files are stripped

The port has descriptors and contracts and nothing else. 1,270 doc-comment  
lines are 635. What was argued in the source is argued in  
`ref/3tk-decisions-001.md`, once.

### Advice

**Clear the context.** 3TK-36 is the stage the other five exist to make  
possible, and it is the only one that invents wording. Its inputs are  
`3tk/src` after the strip, the two `ref/` files, `../common/`, and 042 — not  
this transcript.

## 2026-08-26 — 3TK-34, the strip: `managed.c3`, `queue.c3`, `stack.c3`

**Ran on the owner's word, third of plan 016's six.** The same stage as 3TK-33  
on three more files. Subtraction, and nothing else: no declaration, no  
signature, no body, no string literal changed.

### What was on the table

**319 doc-comment lines across three files**, 7 contracts, and 5 banned-word  
hits — 4 of them inside `stack.c3`'s essay on why the pool reuses last-in  
first-out. No `.md` reference falls in these files.

### What was done

**Every doc comment reduced to a descriptor and its contracts**, in ztk's  
register: one fact per line, no bold, no argument.

- **319 doc lines to 139.** `managed.c3` 93 to 37, `queue.c3` 139 to 64,
  `stack.c3` 87 to 38.
- **Every `@param` kept character-identical**, compared as sorted lines on both
  sides: `managed.c3` 6, `queue.c3` 1, `stack.c3` 0.
- **Zero banned-word hits.** 5 before.
- **No bold marker and no trailing backslash survives.**
- **The five `// ---` section banners kept**, their essays deleted.

**No claim was left without a home.** Every line deleted is already an entry in  
`ref/3tk-decisions-001.md`. None had to be reported as homeless.

**Markers moved into marks, the 3TK-32 shape.** 23 new `// [3tk: ...]` marks  
above declarations, carrying the `D`, `R`, `H`, `V`, `E`, `P` and Part  
citations the prose took with it. 27 marks in these three files now, 4 before.  
The same judgment 3TK-33 recorded: plan 016 lists the mark among what a doc  
comment keeps and does not authorize new ones, but 3TK-32 set the rule that no  
marker is lost.

**`stack.c3`'s last-in first-out essay came out, and it is the deletion worth  
refusing.** Twenty source lines, written for the later reader who would  
otherwise take the stack for an arbitrary choice and change it back to a queue.  
It is a design argument, so it goes where design arguments live;  
`ref/3tk-decisions-001.md` now carries it alone, and its bullet was reworded to  
say so. If it belongs in the source, 3TK-37 is the stage.

### What was verified

- **`3tk/run-builds.sh` green.** Four builds, 63 checks, 87 tests, 0 failures.
- **`c3c docgen` run, and its own `formatDocText` lifted out of the generated
  `docs.html` and run over all 23 doc blocks.** Not read as source. No `<em>`,  
  so no identifier lost its underscores; no literal backslash; no stray `**`.  
  Every declaration name present in the rendered page. The generated  
  `docs.html` was deleted afterwards.
- **The code compared with the doc comments stripped**: identical in all three
  files, line for line.

### The two `ref/` files revised in the same stage

- **`ref/3tk-api-003.md`** — 18 citations into the three files repointed, and
  every citation in the file re-verified live against the quoted text it  
  carries. 0 mismatches.
- **`ref/3tk-decisions-001.md`** — **all 41 citations into the three files
  repointed** to the line each decision now lives at, and all 208 in the file  
  checked to land on a non-blank line.

Four citations had no source line left and were repointed to the nearest true  
home, stated here because it is a judgment: `managed.c3`'s *two modules rather  
than one generator* now points at the `module` line, *composes `mtk::helper`  
through the module* at the `import`, and the `V2` and `Part 8.5` entries for  
`queue.c3` and `stack.c3` at the header's mark line.

**One reference outside `ref/` was stale and was repointed**: `3tk-status.md`'s  
`queue.c3:135` for the absent `push_front`, now `queue.c3:91`.

### Reported, not fixed

The two `hands` hits in `ref/3tk-decisions-001.md`, lines 112 and 416, still  
stand. They pre-date 3TK-33, they are in the `mailbox.c3` and `pool.c3`  
sections, and 3TK-35 is the stage that covers those files.

### Advice

**Clear the context.** The strip is mechanical and 3TK-35 repeats it on the two  
largest files with their own numbers — 481 doc lines, 33 contracts, 6 ban hits.

```
Read design/secondary/lang/c3/3tk-status.md. Run 3TK-35.
```

## 2026-08-26 — 3TK-33, the strip: `mtk.c3`, `inner.c3`, `helper.c3`

**Ran on the owner's word, second of plan 016's six.** Subtraction, and nothing  
else: no declaration, no signature, no body, no string literal changed.

### What was on the table

**470 doc-comment lines across three files**, carrying the essays the owner  
refused twice. All 8 of the port's `.md` references fell here, and 2 banned-word  
hits with them.

### What was done

**Every doc comment reduced to a descriptor and its contracts.** The model is  
the C3 stdlib, and the register is ztk's: one fact per line, no bold, no  
argument.

- **470 doc lines to 194.** `mtk.c3` 55 to 6, `inner.c3` 261 to 89,
  `helper.c3` 154 to 99.
- **Every `@param` and `@require` kept character-identical**, compared as
  sorted lines on both sides: `mtk.c3` 0, `inner.c3` 6, `helper.c3` 17.
- **Zero `.md` references.** 8 before.
- **Zero banned-word hits.** 2 before, both in the `//` essay under
  `inner.c3`'s link-writing banner.
- **No bold marker and no trailing backslash survives** — the two renderer
  rules.
- **The four `// ---` section banners kept**, their essays deleted.

**No claim was left without a home.** Every line deleted is already an entry in  
`ref/3tk-decisions-001.md`. None had to be reported as homeless.

**Markers moved into marks, the 3TK-32 shape.** A doc block that lost a `D`,  
`R`, `H`, `V`, `A`, `Q` or Part citation from its prose gets it back as a  
`// [3tk: ...]` mark on the line above the declaration. 30 marks now, 11 before.  
This is a judgment: plan 016 lists the mark among what a doc comment *keeps*  
and does not authorize new ones, but 3TK-32 set the rule that no marker is  
lost, and a mark is not prose.

**`helper.c3`'s worked example came out.** The fenced `struct Msg` block was  
the one thing deleted that is neither implementation, invariant nor argument.  
It goes because 3TK-36 writes the reference where examples belong and compiles  
them; if the owner wants it back in the source, 3TK-37 is the stage.

### What was verified

- **`3tk/run-builds.sh` green.** Four builds, 63 checks, 87 tests, 0 failures.
- **`c3c docgen` run, and its own `formatDocText` lifted out of the generated
  `docs.html` and run over all 33 doc blocks.** Not read as source. No `<em>`,  
  so no identifier lost its underscores; no literal backslash; no stray `**`.  
  Every declaration name present in the rendered page.
- **The code compared with the doc comments stripped**: identical in all three
  files, line for line.

### The two `ref/` files revised in the same stage

The standing rule: a change to `3tk/src` revises `ref/` in the same stage.

- **`ref/3tk-api-003.md`** — 28 citations into the two files repointed, and
  **all 94 re-verified live** against the quoted text. 0 mismatches.
- **`ref/3tk-decisions-001.md`** — **all 82 citations into the three files
  repointed** to the declaration each decision now lives at, and all 208 in the  
  file checked to land on a non-blank line. **This also clears the pre-existing  
  `helper.c3` drift 3TK-32 recorded and left.** Six bullets reworded where the  
  strip made their wording untrue — *is recorded here*, *and it says so*,  
  *is stated*, *and is named*.

Three citations had no source line left and were repointed to the nearest true  
home, stated here because it is a judgment: `inner.c3`'s *`Outer` is never a  
type* and `helper.c3`'s two *not a wall* entries now point at `mtk.c3`'s mark  
and at `mtk::inner_offset`.

### Reported, not fixed

Two `hands` hits in `ref/3tk-decisions-001.md`, lines 112 and 416, in the  
`mailbox.c3` and `pool.c3` sections. They pre-date this stage, they are in  
files this stage did not otherwise touch, and Part 5 says report, do not fix.

### Advice

**Clear the context.** The strip is mechanical and the next two stages repeat  
it on other files with their own numbers.

```
Read design/secondary/lang/c3/3tk-status.md. Run 3TK-34.
```

## 2026-08-25 — 3TK-32, the strings a user sees

**Ran on the owner's word, first of plan 016's six.** The only stage of the six  
that edits a function body.

### What was on the table

**21 string literals in `3tk/src` cited a specification Part**, and one carried  
a ruling marker. Two places a user meets them and has no document for either.

- **A runtime abort message.** A program that aborts printed a clause number.
  `"Part 9.2 rule 3: an acquisition asserts the Slot is empty on entry"`, at  
  five sites, is the shape: the clause number in front, the fact the user can  
  act on behind the colon.
- **A contract clause `c3c docgen` renders.** `@param remaining` on
  `PoolHooks.on_close` ended in **R12** — a ruling marker printed on a  
  generated documentation page.

### What was done

**The clause number came out. The fact stayed.** All 21, in six files —  
`mailbox.c3` 3, `managed.c3` 1, `queue.c3` 2, `inner.c3` 2, `stack.c3` 1,  
`pool.c3` 12. Counted by grep before and after: **21 to 0**, and the same grep  
finds no ruling marker in any string.

**Nothing was invented.** The stage was allowed to report a string whose whole  
content was a clause number, because no fact could be derived for it. There  
were none. Every one of the 21 had its fact already written after the colon.

**No marker was lost.** 21 new `// [3tk: ...]` marks: 16 on the line above the  
check that lost one, and 5 on the declaration — `on_get`, `on_put`, `on_close`,  
`create`, `Pool.get` — whose doc block lost one, placed between the block and  
the declaration, which is where `helper.c3` already puts them.

**No logic changed.** No condition, no branch, no signature. A message is a  
message.

### Verification

**Four builds green — 63 checks, 87 tests**, safe and fast, `-O0` and `-O3`.

**The negative programs still name what they check.** The suite does not match  
on abort text; the three compile-time negatives match on the type name, and  
those names were never Part numbers — `TwoInners`, `NotAnItem`, `mtk::helper`.  
`inner.c3`'s two-inner `$assert` kept `$Type::name` and lost only *Part 4.4*.

**`c3c docgen` run and the rendered clauses read.** Zero Parts, zero markers in  
any rendered description.

**Reported, not fixed.** `c3c` renders no `@param` description at all for the  
three `PoolHooks` interface methods — the clauses are in the source and the  
generated page drops them. It predates this stage and is not this stage's to  
rule on.

### `ref/3tk-api-003.md`

**001 quoted all 21 verbatim, so it could not survive the edit.** 003 replaces  
it; 001 is in `backup/`.

**Every `file:line` was recomputed.** The 21 marks moved lines under them, so  
all **94 citations** were recomputed and then verified live against `3tk/src` —  
each one re-read at its new line.

**That verification found a debt and paid it.** 17 of the 94 pointed into  
`helper.c3` at lines 3TK-31 had already moved and had not repointed; they were  
resolved by their owning declaration's doc block, not by arithmetic.  
`ref/3tk-decisions-001.md`'s 177 citations into the six edited files were  
shifted with the source in the same stage, as the `ref/` rule requires. **Its  
pre-existing `helper.c3` drift was left** — 3TK-33 rewrites that file's  
comments and will renumber it properly.

**Links repointed**: `3tk-status.md`, `README.md`, `ref/3tk-api-002.md`. The  
`3TK-30` row now names `backup/3tk-api-001.md`, because 001 is what 3TK-30  
produced. The log's older references to 001 stand as history.

### Advice

**Clear the context.** 3TK-33 edits comments in three files and takes nothing  
from this stage's transcript.

```
Read design/secondary/lang/c3/3tk-status.md. Run 3TK-33.
```

## 2026-08-25 — plan 016: the derivation was running backwards

**Not a stage. A plan, written after 3TK-31 was refused a second time.**

### What the owner said

*it mostly description of implementation.*

And then the cause, which is the part that mattered:

*in ztk we wrote api ref md and comments were moved from it, not it's  
opposite. may be we need another model. or create only comments with  
require/ensure - used during run - and add real comments later.*

### The diagnosis

**3TK-31's `init` comment was eight lines, five of them implementation.**  
*stores the identity, does not compute it.* *clears the chain link in the same  
write.* *Every creation site calls it.* None of that is a caller's fact. The  
descriptor is two lines.

**The cause is the order, not the care.** ztk wrote
[../../../matryoshka-api-reference-042.md](../../../matryoshka-api-reference-042.md)
first and moved comments out of it. **3tk has no document of that kind**, so  
3TK-31 had only the old comments to work from — and those are design argument  
and implementation notes. Reworded design argument is still design argument.

**A third careful attempt lands in the same place.** That is why this is a plan  
and not another rewrite.

### The owner's third option is the C3 stdlib's own norm

**Measured 2026-08-25 in `/home/g41797/dev/langs/c3/lib/std/collections/list.c3`.**  
Its doc comments are overwhelmingly contracts alone, with an occasional  
one-line descriptor - *Reverse the elements in a list.* No prose anywhere.

**So "only require/ensure now, real comments later" is not a stopgap.** It is  
where the most-used C3 collection sits today.

**One caution, and it is why a descriptor line stays.** Contracts with no  
descriptor render as a page of parameter tables with no sentence saying what  
anything is. One line costs nothing and is what the stdlib does when it says  
anything at all.

### The plan

**[3tk-staging-plan-016.md](3tk-staging-plan-016.md), six stages, declared and  
not authorized.**

```
3TK-32   the strings a user sees          -> clear
3TK-33   strip: mtk, inner, helper        -> clear
3TK-34   strip: managed, queue, stack     -> clear
3TK-35   strip: mailbox, pool             -> clear
3TK-36   the reference, in 042's shape    -> clear
3TK-37   comments from the reference      -> clear, exemplar only
```

**Three moves, in the owner's own order.** Strip the sources to descriptor and  
contracts. Write the reference. Move the comments out of it.

**Only 3TK-36 invents wording**, and it is a markdown file that can be refused  
without a rebuild. The three strip stages are subtraction, checkable by  
contract count and by diff.

**Six stages means six clear points.** The owner asked for periodic clear and  
the plan is cut to give it.

**3TK-32 runs first** because it is the only stage that edits a body. The strip  
then keeps contracts verbatim without preserving a Part number on its way out,  
and 3TK-36 quotes final strings.

### What was measured for it, so no stage re-derives it

- **2,203 lines in `3tk/src`, 1,270 of them doc comment**, across 8 files and
  97 declarations.
- **63 contract declarations.** `pool.c3` 19, `helper.c3` 17, `mailbox.c3` 14,
  `inner.c3` 6, `managed.c3` 6, `queue.c3` 1, `mtk.c3` 0, `stack.c3` 0.
- **21 string literals cite a specification Part**, and one carries `R12`.
- **8 `.md` references** in comments, all in `mtk.c3` and `inner.c3`.
- **12 Part 4 ban hits.**

**`3tk-staging-plan-015.md` is in `backup/`** and its four live links are  
repointed. 016 reproduces none of its stages.

*Advice on clear: clear now. Plan 016 is written and nothing is authorized.*  
*Continue with:* `Read design/secondary/lang/c3/3tk-status.md. Run 3TK-32.`

---

## 2026-08-25 — 3TK-31: the exemplar, refused once, then written from ztk

**One file. `3tk/src/helper.c3`. The stage stops there and reports.** The  
exemplar before the mechanical pass.

### The first version was refused

The owner's words: *bad ai slop, not follows my rules, aish prose, not  
descriptors, worse than was previously.*

**The fault was the register, not the facts.** The first version kept the old  
file's essay shape and reworded it. Bold-lead paragraphs. A thesis on the first  
line instead of a descriptor. Each variant re-explained from scratch.

**The correction was named by pointing at working code**: `src/*.zig`, ztk's  
own doc comments, and `design/matryoshka-api-reference-042.md`.

### What ztk's comments actually do

Measured by reading `src/polynode.zig` and `src/mailbox.zig`.

- **The first line is a descriptor.** `Clears the intrusive list links.`
  `True if the node has neighbours.` `Reach the PolyNode embedded in T.`
- **No bold anywhere.** Not one `**` in 1,771 lines of ztk source.
- **One fact per line.** `Returns null on type mismatch.` `Never modifies the
  node.` `On failure the Slot is unchanged.` ztk separates them with a trailing  
  `\`; that part does not port, and the next section says why.
- **A variant says `Same as X().` and then only its difference.**
  `mustFromPoly` is two lines: *Same as fromPoly().* / *Panics on type  
  mismatch.*
- **Rationale appears only when it is short and non-obvious.** `Fix laziness of
  std.DoubleLinkedList` is the whole of one. There is no argument anywhere.

### The second version

`helper.c3`, 206 lines, written in that register.

- Every member opens with a descriptor.
- Zero `**` in the file.
- The five variants say *Same as ...* and name only what differs.
- The behaviour is stated as flat facts, one per line, in ztk's own wording
  where the operation is the same one: *On success the Slot is left empty. On  
  failure the Slot is unchanged.*

**The argument is not in the source at all.** That is what
[ref/3tk-decisions-001.md](ref/3tk-decisions-001.md) was written for, and what
the mark points at.

**Nine marks**, one line each, outside the `<* *>` block, so `c3c docgen` never  
sees them:

```c3
// [3tk: H7, Part 5.5, Part 6.3, Part 15.5]
```

Ruling markers and Part numbers only. No filename, no path.

### The owner doubted the `\` hard break, and was right

*am not sure that '\' as hard break supported. what i saw that code snippets  
may be embrassed ```c3 ... ```. you need to check comments in std lib.*

**Both halves were correct.** The `\` was carried over from ztk on the  
assumption that `c3c docgen` renders CommonMark. It does not.

**What was measured**, in `/home/g41797/dev/langs/c3/lib/std` and in the  
generated `docs.html`.

- **The C3 stdlib uses a trailing `\` zero times.** Not once in `lib/std`.
- **It uses ` ```c3 ` fences**, 44 fence lines, in `oneshot_channel.c3`,
  `result.c3`, `array.c3`, `argon2.c3` and others.
- **`docs.html` references `marked` but never loads it.** No `<script src=...>`
  and no bundled copy, so `window.marked` is always undefined. Every doc  
  comment goes through `formatDocText`, a hand-written renderer in the same  
  file.

**`formatDocText` was extracted and run against the real doc text**, rather  
than reasoned about. That is what settled it, and it found two defects that a  
source-level reading does not.

- **A trailing `\` renders as a literal backslash**, and is never needed. The
  renderer already emits `<br>` before every non-blank line in a paragraph.
- **There is no soft wrap, so one source line is one rendered line.** The
  second version's wrapped prose came out broken in half - *The code is  
  generated at the call site,* `<br>` *not per type.* **Every line was  
  rewritten to stand alone.**
- **`must_from_handle()` rendered as *mustfromhandle()*.** The renderer's
  `_text_` italic rule eats the inner underscores of any bare identifier that  
  has two. **Every identifier is now in backticks**, which the renderer  
  extracts before the italic rule runs.

**All of it is written into [3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md)**, so the remaining  
seven files are not written against the wrong renderer.

### Verification

- **Four builds green, 63 checks, 87 tests in each.** Same counts as the
  baseline measured before the file was touched.
- **17 contract declarations before, 17 after, character-identical** —
  `@param` x 13, `@require` x 4, compared as sorted text on both sides.
- **`c3c docgen` run, and its own renderer run over the output.** All 13
  members render a description, every line stands alone, and every identifier  
  survives with its underscores. `[3tk:` appears zero times in `docs.html`.
- **Live scans**: zero `.md` references, from 2. Zero banned words. Zero `**`.
  Zero trailing `\`.
- **Nothing removed without a home.** Every claim from the old comments is in
  the decisions file's `helper.c3` section, checked bullet by bullet. One  
  sentence had no home there and stayed in the file, one line long: *the stdlib  
  reaches for a generic struct when there is state to keep. This helper keeps  
  none.*

**The other seven files are untouched**: `mtk.c3`, `inner.c3`, `managed.c3`,  
`queue.c3`, `stack.c3`, `mailbox.c3`, `pool.c3`.

*Advice on clear: clear after the shape is accepted or refused.*

## 2026-08-25 — the ruling on what the 3tk API reference should be

**Given the same day, alongside the refusal of 3TK-31's first version.** The  
owner's words: *also can read design/matryoshka-api-reference-042.md, similar  
should be 3tk api reference.*

**042 is ztk's book.** Seven parts. Parts 3, 4 and 5 repeat one shape in one  
order: *What this is* / *Participants* / *Usual flow* / *The API, in named  
groups* / *Where to go deeper*. A part learned once is a part learned  
everywhere. Deep dive is explicitly not its job - for that the reader goes to  
`src/`, to an example, or to the docs site.

**`ref/3tk-api-002.md` is not that.** It is a single flat page of sections. It  
has no Participants block, no repeated per-tool shape, and no *Where to go  
deeper*.

**Nothing was done about it here.** It is written down so the next plan  
declares it rather than rediscovering it.

---

## 2026-08-25 — 3TK-30b: the page a caller reads

**The owner read `ref/3tk-api-001.md` and refused it.** *It is absolutely not  
for a human, it is for an AI.* The judgement was right and the measurement  
backs it.

**What was wrong with it, in numbers.**

- **94 citation bullets against 18 lines of example code** in the whole port.
  Provenance outweighed orientation five to one.
- **87 `What` bullets, most of them the declaration's own name read back.**
  *`Slot.take` — take the handle out and clear the Slot.* rules-049 Part 4  
  forbids exactly that — *do not explain WHAT; names do that* — and the rule  
  was in the plan's own section while the file broke it 87 times.
- **30 bullets whose entire content is `O(1)`**, on a toolkit whose queue and
  stack headers already say once that nothing allocates and everything is  
  constant-time.
- **The owner named the sharpest case**: *`Costs` — O(n) in the items kept,
  once, on a pool going down.* Nobody calls close in a loop. A caller cannot  
  act on it, cannot avoid it, and does not need it.
- **No orientation anywhere.** `Mailbox` — the type most callers meet first —
  had no example at all.

**The cause was the template.** Three of the four bullets were mandatory, so  
every entry filled them whether it had something to say or not. A fixed shape  
per entry guarantees a page that is uniform and empty.

**The owner's ruling: keep 001, write 002 before 3TK-31 runs.** Two files, two  
readers, neither pretending to be the other.

**`ref/3tk-api-002.md`, written for the caller.** No fixed template. No  
`file:line`. **No specification clause numbers and no ruling markers anywhere**  
— grepped, zero. Cost is named only where a caller writes different code  
knowing it: it blocks, it allocates, it takes the lock, and `Inner` is sixteen  
bytes every item pays. It leads with the Slot idiom, because that is the part  
that has to be understood before anything else works, and it gives the mailbox  
and the pool a *usual flow* before it gives them a list of calls.

**All 83 public declarations are covered** — checked by grepping every  
declaration name out of `3tk/src` against the page, not by reading.

**Every example was compiled, not eyeballed.** Two scratch files against  
`src/`: the first item, the heterogeneous walk, the iterator, the defer-first  
managed shape, the mailbox flow, the fault-handling shape, the hook object with  
all three methods, the pool flow, and the give-back loop. **All compile.** The  
one form that appears nowhere in the tests — `q.pop_front().to(Msg)` — was  
written into a scratch file for that reason and does compile. The scratch  
`obj/` the compiler produced was removed; it was not covered by `3tk/.gitignore`.

**001 keeps its content and loses its claim.** It is retitled *API  
verification table* and now says in its first lines that it is not the page to  
learn from. **One correction went in with it**: it described seven declarations  
as private, and C3 ignores `@private` on a method declaration and warns that it  
does. They are reachable. Internal by convention, not by a wall.

**3TK-31 now writes from 002, and does not copy from it.** Plan 015 names 001,  
because 015 was written before 001 existed and could not know what it would  
turn out to be. **Plan 015 is not edited** — it is the plan of record and two  
of its stages have run against it — so the redirect is written into
[3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md)'s continue block, where a cold session reads it
before it reads the plan.

**`3tk/src` was not touched.**

*Advice on clear: clear now. 3TK-31's inputs are the `ref/` files.*  
*Continue with:* `Read design/secondary/lang/c3/3tk-status.md. Run 3TK-31.`

## 2026-08-25 — the owner's ruling: a stage is owed for the strings

**Not a stage. A ruling, taken the same day 3TK-30 finished, on something  
3TK-30 found and reported rather than fixed.**

**What was found.** The design vocabulary does not stop at the comments. It is  
inside string literals, in two places a user meets it.

- **Runtime abort messages.** 12 distinct messages cite a specification Part,
  across 16 of the port's 31 check and assert sites. `"Part 9.2 rule 3: an  
  acquisition asserts the Slot is empty on entry"` is at five of them. A user  
  whose program aborts is shown a clause number and has no document for it.
- **Contract clauses `c3c docgen` renders.** 5 of them: three cite a Part, and
  `@param remaining` cites **R12** — a ruling marker printed on a generated  
  documentation page.

**Why neither existing stage takes it.** Plan 015's Part 4 bans are the four  
words it names and the 11 `.md` references; Part numbers inside strings are on  
no list. And **3TK-31 is forbidden from  
touching it** — its own limit is *it changes no code, no body*, and an abort  
message is a string literal in a body. Widening 3TK-31 was the alternative and  
the owner did not take it.

**The ruling: an additional stage, 3TK-32, after plan 015 is spent.** It is  
**planned and implemented then**, by the plan that follows 015 — not declared  
now, and not folded into a stage already running. Nothing else about it is  
decided: what replaces a Part number in an abort message, and whether the trail  
moves to the mark on the line above, are the next plan's to rule.

**The measurement is written into
[3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md)** beside the stage row, so 3TK-32 does not
re-derive it from a conversation that will be cleared.

**One consequence recorded now.**
[ref/3tk-api-001.md](ref/3tk-api-001.md) quotes every one of these strings
verbatim, because Part 4's MUST says a documented assert is copied and never  
inferred. **So 3TK-32 revises it in the same stage** — the standing `ref/` rule  
of the same day.

---

## 2026-08-25 — 3TK-30: the API skeleton

**`ref/3tk-api-001.md`.** One entry per public declaration: what it is, how it  
is called, what it promises, what it costs.

**The surface was counted, not assumed. 83 public declarations.**

- **67 functions and macros** — `fn` and `macro` at column 0, minus the seven
  marked `@private`. Plan 015 expected 67 and the live count agreed exactly.
- **16 types and constants** — `struct`, `enum`, `alias`, `typedef`, `const`,
  `faultdef`, `interface`.
- **3 more** that are not declarations of the port at all: the `PoolHooks`
  methods, which the application implements. Documented separately for that  
  reason.

**The seven private declarations are named in the document and not  
documented.** A reader who greps `src/` and finds `Mailbox.send_at` is told  
where it went rather than left to wonder whether the page missed it.

**92 citations, and every one was verified by reading the line it points at.**  
That is Part 4's MUST, and it earned its cost immediately: **26 of the 92 were  
wrong on the first pass** — pointing at a blank line, at the `<*` above, or at  
the clause before the one quoted. None would have been caught by eye, and all  
26 were repaired and re-verified. The final pass reports 92 of 92.

**66 contract clauses in `src/`, and no `@ensure` anywhere.** Counted live.

**It does not argue, and that was the hard part of the writing.** The source  
comments carry the reasoning in the same paragraph as the promise, so almost  
every entry had to be split: the promise to this document, the argument left  
where the decisions file already holds it. No ruling marker appears in the API  
file.

**Banned-word scan, run live: one hit, `@ensure` at line 28**, in the sentence  
that records there are none in `src/`. It is a C3 contract keyword, the same  
case as the stdlib-name carve-out in Part 5. **Reported, not fixed** — the  
scope rule says hits go to the owner.

**`3tk/src` was not touched.** That is 3TK-31.

*Advice on clear: clear now. 3TK-31's inputs are the two `ref/` files, not this  
conversation — it writes `helper.c3`'s comments from `3tk-api-001.md` and puts  
the marks where `3tk-decisions-001.md` says the argument went.*  
*Continue with:* `Read design/secondary/lang/c3/3tk-status.md. Run 3TK-31.`

## 2026-08-25 — the owner's ruling: `ref/` is revised with the source

**Not a stage. A standing rule, ruled by the owner the same day 3TK-29 created  
`ref/`.**

**The rule.** A change to `3tk/src` revises `ref/` **in the same stage** — not  
later, and not as a debt for the next stage to pay. **A file under `ref/` that  
contradicts `3tk/src` is a defect of the stage that changed the source.**

**The wider half is the owner's own scope, chosen over the narrower one.** The  
narrow version would have said only *revise `ref/` too*. Naming the  
contradiction a defect, and naming whose, is what gives it teeth: the stage that  
touched the source owes the repair, and no later stage inherits it.

**Why it exists.** Every other document in `c3/` is a finished stage output,  
frozen, recording what was true when it ran — a frozen file cannot go stale,  
because it never claimed to be current. `ref/` is the opposite and is the  
folder's only live family, so **it is the only place staleness can hide.**

**Written in two places, on the owner's instruction.**
[3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md), in *Rules that hold across every stage*, beside
the four rules that already bind every stage — the first read of every cold  
session. And in [ref/3tk-decisions-001.md](ref/3tk-decisions-001.md)'s own  
header, after *It is alive*, so a reader arriving at the decisions file directly  
meets it too. That copy states that the rule binds **every** file under `ref/`,  
not only the one carrying it.

**No build check, and that is the owner's call too.** The cheap version was  
available — grep the ruling markers out of `3tk/src`, grep them out of `ref/`,  
compare, which is the pass 3TK-29 already ran by hand. It was declined: it would  
be a change to `3tk/run-builds.sh`, and this ruling is not a stage. **The rule  
is enforced by whoever changes a source, not by the build.**

**Nothing in `3tk/` was touched.** The banned-word scan was re-run live over  
the changed `ref/` file: unchanged bar `owner` going 3 to 4, the new one being  
*the owner's ruling, 2026-08-25* — the human sense, not the exclusive-access  
sense Part 4 bans.

---

## 2026-08-25 — 3TK-29: the decisions, in one file

**Written: [ref/3tk-decisions-001.md](ref/3tk-decisions-001.md).** The first  
file under `ref/`, and the folder was created by this stage. Nine sections: one  
common, then `mtk.c3`, `inner.c3`, `helper.c3`, `managed.c3`, `queue.c3`,  
`stack.c3`, `mailbox.c3`, `pool.c3`. **`3tk/src` was not touched — not one  
character.**

**The checklist was run, not trusted.** `3tk/src` carries **53 distinct ruling  
markers** and **72 distinct Parts**. Both sets were grepped out of the sources,  
grepped out of the new file, and compared with `comm`. **Nothing is missing on  
either list**, and two rounds of that comparison found real gaps: `H9`, which  
`mtk.c3:54` names only inside its list of ruling sets, and seven Parts — 2.9,  
3.1, 4, 9, 9.1, 11 and 15.2 — that the first draft carried in prose without  
naming.

**191 `file:line` citations, every one printed and read.** That is 3TK-22's  
method and 3TK-26's. It caught **28 citations that resolved to a `<*` or to a  
blank line** — technically inside the right doc block, useless to a reader  
opening the file at that line. All 28 now point at the block's first line of  
content, and the pass was re-run after the shift.

**The two entry-point rules the plan set are kept.** The decisions file  
**describes no state** — no dates bar the ones inside a ruling, no stage  
numbers, no what-has-run — and `3tk-status.md` **stays the first read** and  
gains one line pointing here.

**Two things were found and neither is ruled**, which is 3TK-19's precedent.  
They are Appendix B of the new file.

- **The marker letters collide across two documents.**
  `3tk-drafts-review-001.md` numbers its own findings `P1` to `P19`, `D1` to  
  `D20` and `H1` to `H7`, and those are entirely different decisions from the  
  `P`, `D` and `H` series of the audit and the two proposals. A bare `D3` does  
  not say which document it belongs to.
- **`required_alloc_offset` is declared twice, identically** — `inner.c3:377`
  and `managed.c3:117`, same macro, same doc comment. Both call sites,  
  `managed.c3:79` and `managed.c3:99`, name the `mtk::` one. Whether the second  
  declaration is reachable at all is a question no document has answered.

**Appendix A accounts for what the sources do not cite.** Sixteen rows: rulings  
that were superseded (`D8`, `H1` to `H4`), retired (`R4`), refused (`R6`),  
process-only (`D11`), or whose subject is the tests, the specification's own  
text or the sanitizer runs (`H9`, `S1` to `S7`, `V8` to `V10`, `V14` to `V17`).  
**Nothing was dropped silently.**

**Banned-word scan, run live over the new file. Four hits, reported and not  
fixed**, per Part 5.

- `hands` **2** — *hands the signal on* at the wait-loop entry, and *hands a
  container to the application* at `push_back_slot`. Both quote the sources'  
  own wording.
- `owner` **3** — all three name the human owner, recording who ruled. None is
  the exclusive-access sense Part 4 bans.
- `fires` **1** — *a `@require` that fires at the CALLER's line*, quoting
  `helper.c3:42`.
- `object` **3** — a mailbox as an object, the hook's implementing object, and
  *no per-type object*. **None refers to an item**, so the scoped ban does not  
  reach them.

**`run-builds.sh` green — four builds, 63 checks, 0 failed, 87 tests in every  
mode**, and the layering grep `ok`. A formality for a stage that wrote no code,  
run rather than assumed.

**One thing the plan did not ask for and this stage did not do.**
[README.md](README.md) indexes every live `*.md` in the folder, one line each,
and it does not yet name `ref/`. 3TK-29's outputs are the new file, the status  
file and this log, and a stage does not rewrite a finished stage's output. It is  
the owner's call, and `ref/` will hold at least two more files before it  
matters.

**Clear the context. The next stage is 3TK-30**, and the line is  
`Read design/secondary/lang/c3/3tk-status.md. Run 3TK-30.` 3TK-29 read all  
2,229 lines of `3tk/src` plus four ruling documents; 3TK-30 reads the same  
sources for a different purpose and starts better cold.

---

## 2026-08-25 — plan 015: the sources stop serving the AI

**Written: [3tk-staging-plan-015.md](backup/3tk-staging-plan-015.md).** 014 is in  
`backup/` and its live links became plain names, because the owner empties that  
folder. **015 reproduces none of 014's five stages** — the practice ruled on  
2026-08-25 holds.

**The owner's input is [3tk-doc-split.md](3tk-doc-split.md)**, saved before the  
plan was cut and in the owner's own words. It is advice, not a ruling: the  
rulings are in the plan.

**The problem, measured rather than asserted.** `3tk/src` is 2,229 lines and  
**1,305 of them are `<* *>` doc-comment lines — 58%**, plus 168 `//` lines,  
leaving 756 of code and blank. `mtk.c3` is 58 lines of which **55** are doc  
comment. Roughly two lines of prose for every line of code.

**And the prose argues.** 270 `Part N.N` references across 72 distinct Parts,  
about 130 ruling markers — `R6b` 14 times, `H0` 7, `D3` 7, `D1` 6 — and 11  
references to a design document by filename. **What it does not say is what a  
thing is for or how to call it.** `c3c docgen` exists in 0.8.3, so the  
documentation target is real.

**Three stages, in number order, each depending on the one before.**

**3TK-29 — `ref/3tk-decisions-001.md`.** Nine sections: one common, then one per  
source file, in reading order. A decision is one short entry — what stands, its  
marker, its `file:line`. **Accumulated, not argued.** It becomes the source of  
truth for the owner and for an AI, and it **does not touch `3tk/src`**.

**3TK-30 — `ref/3tk-api-001.md`.** The API reference **skeleton**, the owner's  
word: enough to improve on, not a book. It is the source the new source comments  
are written from, so the wording is decided once in a document rather than  
invented eight times in eight files. It **does not touch `3tk/src`** either.

**3TK-31 — the marks and the new comments**, written from 3TK-30's file.  
**`helper.c3` alone**, as the exemplar, and then the stage stops and reports —  
the folder's own rule that the exemplar comes before the mechanical pass.

**The `ref/` folder is the owner's ruling.** Both new documents live in  
`design/secondary/lang/c3/ref/`, **because they are a different kind of file**:  
every live document in `c3/` today is a finished stage output, frozen; these two  
are alive, versioned, and will multiply the way ztk's reference reached `-042`.  
**ztk also carries patterns and other files used to build its site, and 3tk will  
likely carry the same.** One `backup/`, not two.

**rules-049.md binds all three, and the owner named the API document  
especially.** What carries over from the Zig rules: Part 4's *do not explain  
WHAT*, *no `.md` references in source comments*, *comments are self-contained*;  
Part 4's MUST that **a document lists only asserts that exist in `src/`, copied  
and never inferred** — ztk shipped fifteen that could not have compiled; Part  
4's ban on *owner* and *ownership* language; Part 4's live-scan rule; Part 6's  
staccato and its markdown rules. **Part 5's banned-word scan skips  
`design/secondary/` because those files are frozen — `ref/` is not, so the owner  
ruled it in scope.**

**What `3tk/src` carries today, measured and to be removed by 3TK-31:**  
`owner`/`ownership` **9** — five in the exclusive-access sense, four attributing  
a ruling — `drain` **2**, `sweep` **1**, `settle` **1**, and the 11 `.md`  
references.

**Two hazards are written into the plan because a green build does not catch  
them.** A C3 `<* *>` block carries **compiled** contracts — `@require`,  
`@ensure`, `@param`, `@return?` — so a comment rewrite can delete a runtime  
check while looking like a text edit; 3TK-31 must move them verbatim and state  
the count on both sides. And several source comments are today the **only**  
place something is written in that form, so removal is a move and never a  
delete.

**A new standing requirement, the owner's, 2026-08-25: every stage ends with the  
clear-or-not advice and the exact line to continue with**, written into this  
file and the status file rather than only spoken. Advice that lives in a  
conversation about to be cleared is worth nothing.

**No stage of 015 has run and none is authorized.** No code was written, no edit  
to `../common/`, no `git` command.

**Build, a formality and run rather than assumed:** `3tk/run-builds.sh` green,  
**four builds, 63 checks, 87 tests**.

*Advice on clear: clear now. 3TK-29 is next and its inputs are its own —  
`3tk-status.md`, plan 015's 3TK-29 section, `3tk-doc-split.md` and `3tk/src`.*  
*Continue with:* `Read design/secondary/lang/c3/3tk-status.md. Run 3TK-29.`

## 2026-08-25 — the citations 3TK-26 did not reach, and the status file's own debt

**[3tk-deviations-001.md](3tk-deviations-001.md), twenty-two citations  
repointed.** 3TK-26 paid the `inner.c3` ones and reached no further, so the  
audit's `pool.c3`, `mailbox.c3`, `queue.c3`, `stack.c3` and `helper.c3`  
citations were still where 3TK-12 measured them on 2026-08-24 — through 3TK-15's  
deleted guards, 3TK-16's helper rewrite and 3TK-21's `inner.c3`. **Every one was  
printed and read on both sides before it moved, and printed again after.** No  
citation now points past the end of a file, and none did before; the two numbers  
that looked out of range were `t_queue.c3` and `t_stack.c3` read as `queue.c3`  
and `stack.c3`.

**The two open findings were the worst of it, and that is why this was not  
cosmetic.** **P3**'s evidence — the wait loop that can return the condition  
variable's own fault — read `mailbox.c3:289-291` and `pool.c3:372-374`; the code  
is at `:312-314` and `:430-432`. **P4**'s — the pool's leaver signalling on one  
bucket — read `pool.c3:378-383`; it is at `:436-439`, and its supporting claim  
that every path making an item available calls `broadcast` cited `:438` and  
`:499` for lines now at `:545` and `:606`. A reader following P4's own pointer  
landed in a doc comment.

**P4's quoted block is re-cut, and the finding does not move.** As measured the  
leaver sat inside an `if (b)` guard; **3TK-15 deleted that guard as unreachable  
when it built `UNKNOWN_IDENTITY`**, which moved the lines and left what they do  
alone. Repointing without re-cutting would have left a quotation of code that no  
longer exists — 3TK-19's lesson, *a stale citation and a stale claim wear the  
same clothes* — so the block is today's and one sentence says so and why.

**What quotes code a ruling has since changed was left exactly as measured.**  
P1's interleaving block and P2's `NOT_AVAILABLE~` block describe the port before  
the fixes that closed them, and P6's `stack.c3` and `t_stack.c3` citations name  
`InnerStack.push_slot`, which the owner deleted on 2026-08-24. **Repointing a  
measurement falsifies it**, which is 3TK-26's rule for the three quoted-compiler  
numbers, applied to a wider class. **P6's two live claims did move** — `send_at`  
into `push_back` and `take_back` into `push` are unchanged code and the pointers  
had simply drifted.

**One name changed rather than one number**: `t_owned.c3:63` is  
`t_managed.c3:63`, the same line in the file the module rename renamed.

**No verdict, no scope, no finding text and no version.** The audit is still 001  
and V1 to V19 stand; the change log carries one additive row, this document's own  
practice since 3TK-16.

**[3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md) was stale about its own debt, in two places.**  
It still said the `inner.c3` citations were unpaid and named the pass as the  
owner's to schedule — **3TK-26 ran on 2026-08-25 and paid all 21**, and the  
status file is the file a cold session reads first. Both paragraphs now say so,  
and one of them names `3tk-any-options-001.md` as retired rather than as owing a  
repair. A paragraph records this pass beside them.

**And the status file had never named the port's two open defects at all.** P3  
and P4 are the only findings of the six still open, and a cold reader had to open  
the audit to learn they exist. They are now one bullet under *Open questions*,  
with what each is, why nothing is lost today, and the smallest repair — and  
**neither is ruled**, so the bullet decides nothing.

**No code in any language was written.** `3tk/` is untouched, `../common/` is  
untouched, and no `git` command was run. Not a stage: nothing declared, no plan  
version, no new document.

**Build, a formality and run rather than assumed:** `3tk/run-builds.sh` green,  
**four builds, 63 checks, 0 failed, 87 tests**.

**One thing found and not done.** The same broken-`backup/` link this morning's  
pass fixed in the status file and this one **survives as the provenance line of  
seven other documents** — the containers, toolkit, sanitizer, redesign and  
deviations notes, the helper proposal and porting proposal 004 each open by  
naming the plan version they ran under, and those plans have left `backup/`.  
One line each, the same repair, and **not this pass's scope.**

---

## 2026-08-25 — the broken `backup/` links in the two entry points

**Thirty markdown links pointed into `backup/` at files that are no longer  
there** — 22 in [3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md), all in its *Superseded* list, and  
8 in this file, one at the head of each plan-cut entry. **Thirteen distinct  
targets**: `3tk-staging-plan-001.md` through `-011.md`, and  
`3tk-porting-proposal-001.md` and `-002.md`. The owner empties `backup/` in the  
ordinary course, so the files left and the links stayed.

**Each link lost its target and kept its name**, which is the practice plan 014  
set on the same day: *013 is in `backup/`; its live links became plain names  
rather than links, because the owner empties that folder.* So  
`[3tk-staging-plan-001.md](...)` is now `` `3tk-staging-plan-001.md` `` and the  
one `[005](...)` in the plan-005 entry is `` `005` ``. **The names carry the  
meaning and not one of them moved** — these are provenance, which plan version a  
stage ran under and which proposal a version replaced, and the folder's rule is  
that provenance keeps the name while only the target moves. Here the target was  
gone, so only the target went.

**Nothing else was touched.** Every other `backup/` link in the two files  
resolves and was left as it stands — the `any` options and revision, the naming  
and fifo-lifo notes, the helper alternatives, findings 001 and 002, plans 012 and  
013, the three proposal reviews, the addendum, redesign proposal 001, and the  
three `../common/backup/` specifications. **The backticked mentions in prose were  
left as written**: `3tk-status.md`'s and this file's reports of 3TK-23's finding  
name those paths as a finding, not as links.

**No claim changed** — not a verdict, not a date, not a stage row, not a  
sentence. **Not a stage**: plan 014 is spent, 015 is not written, nothing is  
declared and no version was bumped. No file was moved, restored or created; no  
code, no `../common/`, no `git` command.

**Verified by resolving rather than by eye.** The pass that found the thirty  
prints nothing now, and a second pass over *every* link in both files — not only  
the `backup/` ones — finds no broken target at all.

---

## 2026-08-25 — 3TK-28: a README for the folder

**Eighteen files and no index, which is most of why the folder read as a heap.**  
Written as [README.md](README.md), 77 lines. One line per live file: what it is,  
and who reads it. Entry points first, then what is read from `../common/`, then  
the design of record, the port measured, the notes, the one open question, and  
the code.

**It is an index, not a summary.** It re-describes no document's content and  
rules on nothing. The reader column for the seven notes files is
[3tk-readership-001.md](3tk-readership-001.md)'s, taken as it stands.

**Verified by printing.** Every live `*.md` in the folder appears exactly once,  
and every link resolves — checked mechanically, not by eye. **It links nothing  
into `backup/`**, which is named once in prose as the place the owner empties.

It ran last of plan 014's five because it names the folder as 3TK-25 and 3TK-27  
left it. No code, no `git`, no `../common/`, and no file moved.

**Build, run rather than assumed:** `3tk/run-builds.sh` green, **four builds, 63  
checks, 87 tests**.

---

## 2026-08-25 — 3TK-27: who reads the notes

**Seven files read against one test — who opens this, and when.** The six  
`*-notes-*` files and [3tk-drafts-review-001.md](3tk-drafts-review-001.md),  
1,945 lines. Written as [3tk-readership-001.md](3tk-readership-001.md), 150  
lines. **It retires nothing and no file in the folder moved**, which is the  
shape the owner ruled: a stage that finds itself deciding reports instead.

**Three are read, four are not.** The toolkit and container notes are on dtk's  
own reading list; the sanitizer notes are the route through a machine with no  
sanitizer runtimes. The redesign notes, the debts notes, the helper notes bar  
their §8, and the drafts review have no reader — the drafts review because all  
seven of its subjects are in `backup/` and the two documents that quote its  
conflict register reproduce what they took.

**Two stale passages surfaced and neither was repaired**, because both sit in a  
finished stage's output. `3tk-debts-notes-001.md` still reads as owing the P2  
mark that 3TK-19 made on 2026-08-24, and `3tk-helper-notes-001.md` §8 quotes a  
`helper.c3` header sentence that 3TK-19 rewrote — §8's own condition, *when 004  
is cut*, has arrived.

No code, no `git`, no `../common/`, no new version of anything.

**Build, run rather than assumed:** `3tk/run-builds.sh` green, **four builds, 63  
checks, 87 tests**.

---

## 2026-08-25 — 3TK-26: the stale `inner.c3` citations

**Twenty-one line citations repointed, in three files**, after 3TK-21 rewrote  
`inner.c3` end to end and moved every line in it. Nine in
[3tk-deviations-001.md](3tk-deviations-001.md) — including V1, V5 and V12, the
three rows that describe the inner's shape — seven in
[3tk-debts-notes-001.md](3tk-debts-notes-001.md), five in
[3tk-helper-proposal-001.md](3tk-helper-proposal-001.md). Every one was printed
and read on both sides before it moved, 3TK-22's method, and every one was  
printed again after.

**Only the citations moved.** No verdict changed, no row's text changed, no new  
version of any of the three. No code, no `git`, no `../common/`.

**Three `inner.c3:NNN` numbers were left standing on purpose, and they are not  
citations**: `3tk-helper-proposal-001.md:230`, `:802` and `:1078` are inside  
quoted compiler output, recording what `c3c` printed at the time — and two of  
them also say `mtk::owned`, the module's pre-rename name. Repointing a  
transcript would falsify the record rather than repair it.

**One row is current in its pointer and now understates its own subject**: V1  
reads *two fields ... becomes one link plus the self-link terminator*, which was  
written when the inner carried `Inner* link` and `typeid type`. Since 2026-08-25  
it carries one `any link` whose halves are the linkage and the identity, so the  
row's claim that *the two conceptual parts survive* is still true and its arithmetic  
is no longer the whole story. **Left alone**: changing what a finished audit  
claims is the owner's call, not a repointing.

**Build, run rather than assumed:** `3tk/run-builds.sh` green, **four builds, 63  
checks, 87 tests**.

## 2026-08-25 — 3TK-24: the pool difference, written where another port will find it

**Written: [3tk-port-findings-003.md](3tk-port-findings-003.md); 002 moved to
[`backup/`](backup/3tk-port-findings-002.md)** and its three live links
repointed — this file in two places and [3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md) in three.  
No code in any language was written: `3tk/` is untouched and `src/*.zig` at the  
repository root was read and never written. No edit to `../common/`, to  
`design/matryoshka-api-reference-042.md`, or to 002 under `backup/`. No `git`  
command was run.

**One new section, §5a, and nothing else of substance.** On a get in  
available-or-new mode that finds a stored item, **3tk returns without calling  
`on_get`** — `pool.c3:337-345`, the pop, the unlock, the fill, the return —  
while **ztk pops the item, sets the Slot and calls `on_get` anyway**, with the  
Slot full so the hook can reinitialize what came back — `pool.zig:565-590`, no  
early return between the two. All three modes of both ports were read rather  
than assumed, and the other two agree: new-only always calls  
(`pool.c3:337`'s guard, `pool.zig:592-610`) and available-only never does  
(`pool.c3:348-352`, `pool.zig:612-629`).

**The specification sides with 3tk twice and marks neither as a deviation.**  
Part 11.7 words the mode as *take a stored item, else ask the hook*  
(`matryoshka-specification-004.md:962`) and Part 12.2 opens *on get* with *The  
Slot is empty on entry* (`:1064`) — then points at the audit that describes the  
other behaviour, `*ztk*: audit 2.7`, `:1106`. `ztk-audit-001.md:542-545`  
describes ztk exactly and `matryoshka-api-reference-042.md:1449-1452` documents  
it as the contract. **A shared normative document and the audit it was  
distilled from disagree.**

**Why 3tk does it that way, and the honest part of the answer.**  
`3tk-porting-proposal-004.md:1240` states the contract in one line — *`on_get`  
gets an empty Slot* — compiled from the specification for Q5. **No R-ruling and  
no D-decision covers the point**, because the redesign never saw a question  
there. The port's own rule for disagreeing sources sits two paragraphs earlier  
(`:1220-1226`, *the running code is the evidence, the specification is the  
authority*) and was never applied here, since nothing showed the sources apart  
until this was found.

**Two clauses wider than ztk's own code were noticed and left where they  
belong.** The audit's *in every mode* and the book's *regardless of mode* do  
not hold for available-only, which calls no hook. §5a names them as description;  
the book's two wrong lines were already an open question of this file, ztk's to  
fix.

**It recommends nothing.** The word *should* appears in the document only inside  
its own change log, describing itself, as in 001 and 002. Whichever way the  
difference goes — 3tk's code, ztk's code, or Part 12.2 — is the owner's, and  
dtk was not told: the owner ruled on 2026-08-25 that dtk can wait.

**The status file's open question shrank from seventeen lines to eight** and now  
points at §5a rather than restating it.

**Build, a formality and run rather than assumed:** `3tk/run-builds.sh` green,  
**four builds, 63 checks, 87 tests**.

*Advice on clear: clear now. 3TK-26 is next and its inputs are its own.*

---

## 2026-08-25 — 3TK-25: the status file is an entry point again

**[3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md), 1,733 lines to 938.** It said *One screen* on  
line 3 and had said it through eleven stages of accretion. Eight sections came  
out — the seven that began *What 3TK-NN did* and *The gap between the port and  
the specification* — and **one line stands where each stood**, naming the entry  
in this file that already held it. Nine closed open questions came out with  
them. No code, no `git`, no edit to `../common/`.

**The sort was the whole stage, and it came back one-sided.** Every claim in the  
eight sections was read against this log, and **the log had all of it** — 3TK-13  
through 3TK-17 each have a dated entry, the five assumptions have *five  
questions before the cut*, the P1 and P6 rulings have their own, and the whole  
R-register as the owner ruled it is in *the redesign is ruled, question by  
question*. **So this entry carries no history forward**: there was none missing,  
and inventing a summary of what is already written twice would have been a third  
copy rather than a rescue.

**Two things the removed text held that this log does not, and neither is  
history.** How a stage or a revision is asked for — the one-line stage request,  
the agent's first three actions, the revision protocol and the two things a  
revision may not do quietly — and how to verify the port without an agent, the  
two scripts, their optional directory and the fatal `cd`. Both are instructions  
to a reader rather than a record of a stage, so **both stayed in the status  
file**, as sections of their own instead of subsections buried under a heading  
that opens *History*. That is the plan's *it does not delete a claim it cannot  
find a home for*, and it fired twice.

**A ninth claim was false and is carried nowhere.** *The state before 3TK-14*  
recorded **R4 — OUTSTANDING**, on the ground that Part 11.8's MUST forces  
`InnerQueue` to keep a front insert for a refused list put. **R15 dropped  
`Pool.put_all` and retired R4 with it** — `3tk-core-redesign-proposal-002.md:606`  
says so in the register's own table — and the port has no `push_front`:  
`queue.c3:135` says *There is no `push_front` — R15 dropped `Pool.put_all`,  
which was its only caller*. The paragraph was written before the ruling and  
survived it by two days, in the file a cold session reads first.

**Two claims moved rather than went.** The log's dozen older banned-word hits,  
deliberately left as they are, is a **standing fact and not a question** — it  
asks nothing of anybody — so it moved to *Standing facts*. And the worked  
example, the one row of the removed candidates table that *What is left* did not  
already carry, became a bullet there; the other four rows — cross-target builds,  
packaging, MemorySanitizer, and `3tk-porting-proposal-005.md` — were already in  
that section or in this log.

**The open questions were reviewed, and nine of the eighteen were closed  
already.** A struck-through question is history: the two doc comments citing  
003 and the stale P2 row (3TK-19), the `any` ruling's retirement, the three  
Part 5 words in this file, the allocator direction, and 3TK-8's four questions  
ruled 2026-08-23 before that stage started. Every one is recorded here under the  
stage or ruling that closed it, so none needed carrying. **Two more shrank  
rather than closed**: otk's, which is now only *does otk get a status file* now  
that 3TK-19 wrote the pointer, and `Pool.get_wait`'s, which is now only the ztk  
book's two wrong lines.

**And one closed on the owner's ruling.** The **forty broken `backup/` links**  
3TK-23 reported point at files the owner removed from `backup/` in the ordinary  
course. `backup/` is a holding area and the owner empties it; nothing cites it  
as a source of truth. **Routine housekeeping, not a defect**, and filing it as  
an open question was 3TK-23's mistake to make and this stage's to unmake.

**The ztk/3tk `on_get` difference stays as it was written.** 3TK-24 is declared  
to write it up as §5a of the findings document and **has not run**, so there is  
nothing yet to point a one-line summary at.

**Green, and a formality: `run-builds.sh` 63 checks, 0 failed, four builds, 87  
tests.** Nothing under `3tk/` was opened except to read `queue.c3` and the  
redesign proposal for the R4 check.

*Advice on clear: clear now. 3TK-24 is next and its inputs are its own.*

---

## 2026-08-25 — plan 014, and a plan stops reproducing itself

**Written: `3tk-staging-plan-014.md`, 301 lines for five  
stages.** 013 is in `backup/`; its live links became plain names rather than  
links, because the owner empties that folder.

**Two rulings of the owner's, both new practice.** A **plan holds only what has  
not run** — 013 was 2,775 lines because every version reproduced every earlier  
stage. And **`backup/` is a holding area, not an archive**, so nothing cites it  
as a source of truth. That also closes the forty broken `backup/` links 3TK-23  
reported: routine housekeeping, never a defect.

**The five, all declared and not authorized:** 3TK-24 findings 003, §5a, the  
ztk/3tk pool difference; 3TK-25 the status file back to an entry point, 793  
lines of narrative to this log; 3TK-26 the stale `inner.c3` citations, the write  
authorized explicitly; 3TK-27 who reads the six notes files, **retires  
nothing**; 3TK-28 a README, last.

**The intent is the owner's: clean the folder before the next big stage.** 17  
files, 16,079 lines. **dtk is told nothing** and the log's past is left alone,  
both ruled the same day.

---

## 2026-08-25 — the waiting get never creates, and it is on purpose

**The owner's claim, checked against every source and confirmed:**  
`Pool.get_wait` asks for an *existing* item, so not calling `on_get` is  
deliberate and not an omission. It takes a stored item or waits until one is put  
back; there is nothing for a creation hook to do, and creating on this path  
would make the timeout unreachable and turn a wait into a `new_only` get.

**Five sources, all agreeing, none of them needing a change.** 3tk's  
`pool.c3:396` implements it and its doc comment opens *It never creates. No hook  
is called on this path.* ztk's `pool.zig:247` says *Does not call the `on_get`  
hook. It takes a stored item or waits for one.* `ztk-audit-001.md` 5.2 recorded  
it. **Specification Part 11.9 states it as a MUST** — *the waiting get takes a  
stored item or waits for one; it calls no creation hook* — and calls the  
divergence from available-only's not-available deliberate. **No code and no  
specification was touched**, because nothing was wrong with any of them.

**What was wrong was this file's framing.** The status file carried it under  
open questions as *`Pool.get_wait` does not call `on_get`. The book says twice  
that it does*, which reads as a doubt about the port when the only open thing is  
the book. Rewritten to say the reason first and the book second.

**The book's two lines were re-read and neither has moved since the audit.**  
`matryoshka-api-reference-042.md:1288` still says *Calls `on_get` hook* under  
`get_wait`, and `:1448-1449` still says `on_get` is *called for every `get` and  
`get_wait` call regardless of mode*. The second is wrong a second way that  
audit 5.2 names in passing and the sentence itself does not: **available-only  
calls no hook either**, `pool.zig:612-629`. Fixing the book is the ztk line's  
work and no stage of this line touched it.

**And the check turned up something nobody had written down.** **3tk and ztk do  
different things on the most ordinary pool path there is.** In available-or-new  
mode 3tk pops a stored item and returns without calling the hook  
(`pool.c3:337-345`); ztk pops it and calls `on_get` anyway, with the Slot  
**full**, so the hook can reinitialize what came back (`pool.zig:565-586`).  
**The specification sides with 3tk twice** — Part 11.7 words the mode as *take a  
stored item, **else** ask the hook*, Part 12.2 opens `on get` with *The Slot is  
empty on entry* — and **marks neither as a ztk deviation**, though  
`ztk-audit-001.md` 2.7 describes ztk's behaviour correctly and the book  
documents it as the contract. So a shared normative document and the audit it  
was distilled from disagree, and nothing in `c3/` says so.

**Recorded, not ruled, and filed as an open question.** It touches  
`../common/`, which is every port's and not this line's to edit; it changes what  
dtk would build; and whichever way it goes, one of the three moves — 3tk's code,  
ztk's code, or Part 12.2. **The port docs describe and do not recommend**, which  
is the owner's rule of 2026-08-24, so this entry names the difference and stops  
there.

**No code in any language was written**, no edit to `../common/` or to  
`design/matryoshka-api-reference-042.md`, and no `git` command was run. Two  
documents changed: this one and [3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md).

---

## 2026-08-25 — the owner retires the `any` ruling

**[3tk-any-options-001.md](backup/3tk-any-options-001.md) moved to `backup/`, on  
the owner's instruction of the same day.** Not a stage: plan 013 named this file  
as 3TK-23's one exception and said that once 3TK-21 had run, whether it is  
retired **is the owner's call and not the stage's**. 3TK-23 left it in the live  
folder and reported the question. This is the answer to that question.

**Six links repointed** — [3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md) in four places,
[3tk-log.md](3tk-log.md) in five, [3tk-port-findings-002.md](backup/3tk-port-findings-002.md),
and `3tk-staging-plan-013.md`. Prose mentions in  
backticks were left as written, which is the folder's rule: provenance keeps the  
name, only the target moves.

**One link inside the moved document was repointed, and it is the first time  
that clause has had anything to do.** Its §1 line names its input,
[3tk-any-revision.md](backup/3tk-any-revision.md), which 3TK-23 had just retired
— so the file arrived in `backup/` carrying `](backup/3tk-any-revision.md)`, a  
path written for the live folder and broken from inside `backup/`. The two now  
sit beside each other and the link reads `](3tk-any-revision.md)`. The  
document's content is otherwise untouched: a retired document is moved, not  
annotated. The two `backup/` documents that cite it — `3tk-port-findings-001.md`  
and `3tk-staging-plan-012.md` — went from broken to resolving for the same  
reason the four of 3TK-23 did.

**Nothing was deleted and nothing in `backup/` was overwritten**; the name did  
not exist there. **The forty pre-existing broken `backup/` targets are still  
open** and this move neither caused nor touched them.

**What the live folder now holds: 17 documents**, down from 22 at the start of  
the day. `3tk-who-supports-slot.md` is still among them — it is open, and an  
open question is not a finished input.

**Build, a formality and run rather than assumed:** `3tk/run-builds.sh` green.  
**four builds, 63 checks, 87 tests**. No code in any language was written, no  
edit to `../common/`, and no `git` command was run.

---

## 2026-08-25 — 3TK-23: retire what is no longer read

**Four finished inputs moved to [`backup/`](backup/), nothing deleted, no  
document's content edited beyond link targets.** No code in any language was  
written: `3tk/` is untouched and `src/*.zig` at the repository root was neither  
read nor written. No edit to `../common/`. No `git` command was run — the moves  
are plain `mv`.

**The four, each with the sentence that retires it:**

- **[3tk-naming-001.md](backup/3tk-naming-001.md)** — the owner's input to
  3TK-10. The status file already said it and the next file were *carried out by  
  3TK-10 and 3TK-11 and are history now*.
- **[3tk-to-fifo-lifo-single-001.md](backup/3tk-to-fifo-lifo-single-001.md)** —
  same sentence, same stages. Its §9 and §17 set the required-operation audit  
  that §1.1 then ran.
- **[3tk-helper-alternatives.md](backup/3tk-helper-alternatives.md)** — the
  owner's first input to 3TK-14, *advice, not a ruling*, and it withdraws its  
  own favourite proposal near the end. 3TK-14 measured both its shapes and the  
  compiler refused both.
- **[3tk-any-revision.md](backup/3tk-any-revision.md)** — the owner's document
  behind the `any` ruling of 2026-08-24, consumed by
  [3tk-any-options-001.md](backup/3tk-any-options-001.md).

**Eighteen links repointed** across six live documents — the redesign proposal  
002, the helper proposal 001, the `any` options 001, this file,
[3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md) and
`3tk-staging-plan-013.md`. **Provenance kept the name;  
only the target moved.** Every prose mention in backticks — and the redesign  
proposal alone carries eight — was left exactly as written, because a citation  
of what a document said is not a link to where it now sits.

**The four carry no links of their own back into the folder.** Every `](` in  
them is an external `c3-lang.org` URL, so the known imperfection this stage was  
told not to fix and not to worsen did not arise. It went the other way: the  
superseded documents in `backup/` that wrote `](3tk-naming-001.md)` for the live  
folder — 012 and the redesign proposal 001 — now resolve, because the target  
finally sits beside them.

**Nothing in `backup/` was overwritten**; none of the four names existed there,  
and the stage refused before moving rather than checking after.  
**[3tk-who-supports-slot.md](3tk-who-supports-slot.md) is still in the live  
folder**, because the status file calls it open and ruled on by nothing, and an  
open question is not a finished input.

**Two things the stage found and did not do, reported instead — 3TK-19's  
precedent.** First, **3TK-21 has run**, so by the plan's own exception whether
[3tk-any-options-001.md](backup/3tk-any-options-001.md) is retired is the owner's call
and not this stage's; it was left where it is. Second, a full resolve pass over  
every live link turned up **forty broken targets that predate this stage** —  
`backup/3tk-staging-plan-001.md` through `-011`, `backup/3tk-porting-proposal-001.md`  
and `-002`, cited by the status, the log and five notes documents. They are  
absent from `backup/`. Not caused here, not repaired here, and named for the  
owner.

**Build, a formality and run rather than assumed:** `3tk/run-builds.sh` green,  
**four builds, 63 checks, 87 tests**.

## 2026-08-25 — 3TK-22: the findings document, against the shape it now describes

**Written: [3tk-port-findings-002.md](backup/3tk-port-findings-002.md); 001 moved to
[`backup/`](backup/3tk-port-findings-001.md)** and every live link that named it
repointed — this file, [3tk-status.md](3tk-status.md) and  
`3tk-staging-plan-013.md`. No code in any language was  
written: `3tk/` is untouched and `src/*.zig` at the repository root was read and  
never written. No edit to `../common/`. No `git` command was run.

**The repair.** 3TK-21 rewrote `inner.c3` end to end, so §1's central code block  
quoted a struct that no longer exists and most of the document's `inner.c3` and  
`helper.c3` citations had moved. Re-cut, pasted rather than typed: the `struct  
Inner` block (`inner.c3:75-78`), `is_linked` (`inner.c3:261`), the four walk  
sites (`queue.c3:123`, `queue.c3:187-194`, `stack.c3:108`, `stack.c3:124`),  
tier 2's `@check` (`inner.c3:216-221`), the tier 3 flag and its one reader  
(`inner.c3:230`, `pool.c3:235`), §8's `is_mine` — which said `h.type` and now  
says `h.link.type` — and the helper's span, `helper.c3:76-232`.

**Every `file:line` in the document was printed and read, both sides.** Every  
ztk citation 001 carried was re-verified against `src/*.zig` and **not one had  
moved**; ztk has not changed since 3TK-20. The one `list.c3:251-256` in §2  
is inside a quotation from the redesign proposal's audit and stays as quoted —  
it cites a file the redesign deleted, which is what the audit was about.

**The new material is §1a, and it is why this was not merely a repair.** A port  
storing the identity and the chain link as one built-in type-erased pair,  
because the language ships the pair the port would otherwise write by hand, is a  
port decision another port would care about — and dtk is the reader who would,  
since D answers the same question with different machinery. **Its cost is named  
where the shape is described**: `any`'s halves are read-only, so a link write  
rebuilds the whole value and carries the identity through by hand, and a site  
that hands over the wrong identity destroys an item's type silently. That hazard  
is what `Inner.repoint_to` exists to remove, and the two-field shape did not  
have it. §1a also records the two things the language decided rather than the  
port — the methods are on `Inner` and not on `any`, and `@private` does not  
apply to a C3 method — and, under *What ztk does*, that `PolyNode` keeps the  
identity in its own `tag: *const anyopaque` field where a link write cannot  
reach it.

**The ruling it ran under held.** Description and reasoning, not  
recommendations: **the word *should* appears nowhere in 002**, as it appeared  
nowhere in 001; no section is ordered by urgency, severity or cost; §1a is a  
peer of §1 and not a headline; and nothing is concluded from the difference with  
ztk. §1a's numbering follows the folder's habit of not renumbering what is  
already written — §2 to §10 keep their numbers and their text.

**`3tk/` untouched, and the formality was run rather than assumed.**  
`run-builds.sh`: four builds green, **passed 63, failed 0**, 87 tests in every  
mode, Part 17.2's layering grep still `ok`.

---

## 2026-08-25 — 3TK-21: `Inner` is one `any`

**`struct Inner { any link; }`.** `link.ptr` is R6b's chain link, `link.type` is  
Part 5's identity. The two meanings did not move, R6b did not move, and the size  
did not move: **16 bytes before, 16 bytes after** — measured, not assumed, and  
the eight bytes were won by R6b when it deleted `prev`. **No public surface  
change was intended and none was made to `Handle`, `Slot`, `InnerQueue`,  
`InnerStack`, `inner_offset`, the faults or `Inner.to`/`Inner.as`.** No edit to  
`../common/`. No new document, as the plan said there would not be. No `git`  
command was run.

**The probes ran first and one of them refused.**

- **`@private` does not apply to a method in C3.** The compiler *ignores* it and
  warns that it does — `'@private' modifiers are ignored for method  
  declarations`. The plan said *both `@private` if the containers are in module  
  `mtk` proper*, and told the stage to verify rather than assume; the answer is  
  that the condition never gets asked, because the annotation has no effect on a  
  method at all. **`Inner.repoint_to` and `Inner.points_to` are therefore public**,  
  beside `Inner.to` and `Inner.as`. This is recorded here and in `inner.c3`  
  because it is the one thing about the change that came out wider than the plan  
  wanted, and it was the language's answer and not a choice.
- **`any` is 16 bytes and a struct holding one is 16 bytes**, against 16 for the
  two named fields it replaced. Alignment 8, unchanged.
- **A zeroed `any` matches no type** — not `Msg`, not even `void` — and its
  typeid is falsy, which is `any.as_inner`'s own contract `@require  
  (bool)self.type`. That is Part 5.5's uninitialized inner still refusing to be  
  claimed by `helper::is_mine`, and it was measured rather than reasoned.
- **`--safe=no -O3` behaves identically** on the same probe.

**The nine link writes went through `Inner.repoint_to`, and the identity is  
written exactly once.** `grep any_make src/` finds two code sites: `repoint_to`  
itself, whose second argument is `self.link.type`, and `helper::init`, the one  
place the identity is supposed to be set. `grep '\.link\.ptr' src/` finds  
**one** site, `points_to` — the plan expected two, and `repoint_to` turned out  
not to need the pointer half at all, so the `void*` cast lives in a single line  
rather than two.

**The four walk sites were read one at a time, each against its own comment.**  
`InnerQueueIterator.next` and `InnerQueue.pop_front` in `queue.c3`;  
`InnerStack.push` and `InnerStack.pop` in `stack.c3`. `pop_front` still  
recognises the sole item by `head == tail` and not by the link, which is what  
its comment says; the other three now read `n.points_to() == n`, which is the  
design's own sentence — *the last item of a chain points at itself* — spelled  
the same way in the code and in the prose above it.

**`run-builds.sh`'s Part 17.2 grep was repointed, and it was widened.** It read

```
grep -nE '\b(@guard_insert|\.link[[:space:]]*=)\b' src/mailbox.c3 src/pool.c3
```

and it now reads

```
grep -nE '(@guard_insert|\.repoint_to|any_make|\.link[[:space:]]*=)' src/mailbox.c3 src/pool.c3
```

`.link =` alone would have gone on printing `ok` for ever, because a container  
maintaining chains by hand would now write `h.repoint_to(x)` or rebuild through  
`any_make` and never assign the field. **3TK-18 hit this same line and its log  
row is why this stage looked**, and the pattern was checked against `queue.c3`  
to confirm it still bites something.

**`is_linked` and `reset` moved onto the two methods.** `reset` is  
`h.repoint_to(null)`, which clears the link and **keeps the identity** — an item  
that has left a container is still the type it always was. The comment says so,  
because `reset` is one line from looking like it erases both halves.

**Prose repaired, not just code.** `inner.c3`'s struct block was rewritten by  
hand and read in full; `queue.c3` and `stack.c3` headers, `helper::init` and  
`helper::is_mine`, `t_identity.c3`'s and `t_managed.c3`'s headers, and  
`negative/insert_twice_same_queue.c3` all had sentences that named two fields or  
quoted `h.link == h`. `mtk.c3`'s header describes files and modules and said  
nothing the change made false.

**Green.** `run-builds.sh`: **four builds** — safe -O0, safe -O3, fast -O0,  
fast -O3 — **63 checks, 0 failed, 87 tests in each mode**. Unchanged counts, as  
the plan said a field reshuffle would leave them. `run-sanitizers.sh`: **three runs, 0  
findings** — thread safe -O0, thread fast -O3, address safe -O0, each clean at  
87 tests. **This one was not a formality and the plan said so**: the change  
moves what sits at which offset inside every item in the toolkit, so a green  
build alone would have proved less than it looked like. c3c 0.8.3, clang as the  
linker for the sanitized builds.

**One debt was created, reported, and not paid.** Rewriting `inner.c3` by hand  
moved every line in it, so **`3tk-deviations-001.md`'s nine `inner.c3:NNN`  
citations are stale**, V1, V5 and V12 among them — the three rows that describe  
the inner's shape and therefore the three most worth reading correctly.  
`3tk-any-options-001.md`, `3tk-debts-notes-001.md` and  
`3tk-helper-proposal-001.md` carry the same kind of citation. **The plan names  
this stage's outputs as `3tk/`, this log and the status file**, and a stage may  
not rewrite a finished stage's output, so the debt is written down instead.  
3TK-22 already exists to repair `3tk-port-findings-001.md`'s citations and is the  
obvious place to extend, but **that is the owner's to name and the stage did not  
decide it.** 3TK-19's row is the precedent for how these get paid: not with a  
`sed`, because a moved line and a false sentence look identical from outside.

**004 was re-read for the one sentence that could have gone false.** Its *3tk*  
realization line reads *one link field plus the identity*, and that is still  
literally true: one link, one identity, nested now rather than adjacent. Nothing  
in `../common/` was edited and nothing in it needs to be.

## 2026-08-25 — plan 013: `Inner` becomes one `any`, and three stages to do it

**Written: `3tk-staging-plan-013.md`.** 012 moved to  
`backup/`, and every link that named it was repointed — the status file's  
cold-start line, its plan-of-record paragraph, its current-plan entry, its  
superseded list, one versioned-list line, and this file's own 012 row.  
**Provenance keeps the name 012; only the link target moved.** Nothing in  
`../common/` names a plan version later than 009. No `git` command was run.

**Three stages, and nothing before them is altered, reordered or reworded.**

**3TK-21 — `struct Inner { any link; }`.** `link.type` is the identity,  
`link.ptr` is R6b's chain link. **The meanings do not move, R6b does not move,  
and the size does not move**: 16 bytes before and after, because R6b won those  
eight bytes when it deleted `prev`. **A stage that reports a saving has measured  
something else**, and the plan says so, because the temptation to read this as a  
24-to-16 win is real and the win already happened.

**The stage exists as written because of one property of `any`: its halves are  
read-only.** The stdlib was read for this cut — `any_make` at  
`core/builtin.c3:399` is `@builtin`, `any.retype_to` at `:405` keeps the pointer  
and swaps the type, `any.as_inner` at `:413` derives the type — and **no call in  
the whole stdlib assigns `.ptr` or `.type`.** `any` is not even declared there;  
it is compiler-owned. So a link write rebuilds the whole field and carries the  
identity through by hand:

```c3
self.tail.link = any_make(h, self.tail.link.type);
```

**The identity on that line is `self.tail`'s and not `h`'s, and both are on the  
line.** Writing `h.link.type` there compiles, runs, passes every test, and gives  
the tail `h`'s type — silently, because the identity is written once at  
initialization and only read afterwards. **Under two fields a link write could  
not touch the identity. Under one `any` every link write carries it.** That is  
the whole reason the stage adds methods rather than sweeping nine sites.

**`Inner.repoint_to` keeps the type and swaps the pointer** — the corner of the  
stdlib's table that the stdlib does not fill — and **`Inner.points_to`** is the  
reader, which makes the four walk sites read as the design's own sentence: *the  
last item of a chain points at itself*. **The names came from the language**,  
which is 3TK-18's rule applied a second time.

**Methods on `Inner`, ruled by the owner**, against the alternative of extending  
`any` itself: more faithful to the family, and it would put a method on a  
builtin type visible to every module importing `mtk`. **Internals only means the  
narrower surface wins**, and the same test kept the identity reader out  
altogether — it would have to be public for `mtk::helper` to see it, the way  
`@check` is, and reads are safe without it.

**It is a reversal and the plan says so.** The owner rejected `any` within  
`Inner` on 2026-08-24 in all three shapes then offered, took the `next`→`link`  
rename instead, and has now ruled this shape in. **The plan instructs the stage  
not to read [3tk-any-options-001.md](backup/3tk-any-options-001.md)** — the owner's  
instruction, on the ground that everything needed was given directly and is  
written into the stage section. **A stage that goes looking for the old argument  
has left its scope**, and the plan says that too.

**3TK-22 — `3tk-port-findings-002.md`.** The document 3TK-20 wrote quotes  
`struct Inner` verbatim and cites `inner.c3` and `helper.c3` by line all through  
§1, §7 and §8, so **3TK-21 makes its central code block false.** The same  
read-after-stale dependency that put 3TK-19 before 3TK-20, one turn sharper:  
this time the stale thing is a quotation. It is not only a repair — *a port that  
stores the identity and the chain link in one built-in type-erased pair, because  
the language ships that pair* is exactly what the document exists to tell dtk,  
**with the cost named**: the halves are read-only, so a link write carries the  
identity by hand.

**3TK-23 — retire what is no longer read**, at the owner's instruction. Four  
finished inputs move to `backup/`: `3tk-naming-001.md` and  
`3tk-to-fifo-lifo-single-001.md`, which the status file already calls *history  
now*; `3tk-helper-alternatives.md`, advice that 3TK-14 consumed and whose two  
shapes the compiler refused; and `3tk-any-revision.md`, consumed by the `any`  
ruling. **Nothing is deleted, and the links are the work** — the redesign  
proposal cites the fifo-lifo note throughout its §1 and §3, and the helper  
proposal cites the alternatives.

**Two files were considered and left, for different reasons.**  
`3tk-who-supports-slot.md` stays because the status file says it is **open and  
ruled on by nothing** — an open question is not a finished input. And  
`3tk-any-options-001.md` stays because **3TK-21 reverses part of what it ruled**:  
if 3TK-21 has not run the stage leaves it alone, and if it has, **whether a  
reversed ruling is retired is the owner's call and not a stage's**, since a  
ruling that was reversed is exactly what a later reader needs to find. That is  
3TK-19's precedent — a stage that finds itself deciding reports instead.

**3TK-21's sanitizer run is not a formality and the plan marks it so.** Every  
stage since 3TK-9 could treat `run-sanitizers.sh` as optional because none of  
them moved memory. **This one moves what sits at which offset inside every item  
in the toolkit**, so thread and address clean at 87 is a verification item, not  
a courtesy.

**The status file's stage table stopped at 3TK-17 and now runs to 3TK-23.**  
3TK-18, 3TK-19 and 3TK-20 had all run without ever being added to it — the table  
is the cold reader's index and it had been three stages stale.

---

## 2026-08-24 — plan 012: the findings document gets a versioned name

**Written: [3tk-staging-plan-012.md](backup/3tk-staging-plan-012.md).** 011 moved to  
`backup/`, and every link that named it was repointed — the status file's  
cold-start line, its plan-of-record paragraph, its current-plan entry, its  
superseded list and one open-question line, and this file's own 011 row.  
**Provenance keeps the name 011; only the link target moved.** Nothing in  
`../common/` names a plan version later than 009, so nothing there needed  
touching, and no `git` command was run.

**012 declares no stage, and that is the whole of it.** The owner's instruction  
of 2026-08-24: put `3tk-port-findings-NNN.md` in the versioned list. 011's list  
could not name it — the document did not exist when 011 was cut, and 3TK-20  
created a **family**, not just a file. The entry says why it is versioned and  
why it stays here: **it is read by ports other than this one, and a document  
another line cites may not change under the citation**; and it is one port's  
record rather than a shared normative input, which is what `../common/` is for.

**Every stage section is reproduced unaltered, and three headers gained an  
outcome line.** 3TK-18, 3TK-19 and 3TK-20 each now say **HAS RUN** above the  
*declared, not authorized* line they were cut with. **The line below it is not  
edited**, because a plan version does not rewrite history — a section that says  
*declared* is what was true at the cut that declared it, and the log is where  
the outcome lives. **Two of the three headers point at what the section got  
wrong**: 3TK-19's called two citations repointings and neither was, and 3TK-20's  
carried line numbers that had drifted.

**The line is spent.** 3TK-0 to 3TK-20 have all run and nothing is declared and  
unstarted, so 012 is a plan of record with no next stage in it. **The next stage  
is the owner's to name**, and dtk — which none of 3TK-17 to 3TK-20 blocked — is  
free to start from
[`../common/matryoshka-specification-004.md`](../common/matryoshka-specification-004.md),
now with [3tk-port-findings-001.md](backup/3tk-port-findings-001.md) beside it as a  
second input rather than a precondition.

**One thing was left as the folder already had it**, rather than fixed on the  
way past: the superseded plans in `backup/` carry relative links written for the  
live folder — `](3tk-status.md)` — which do not resolve from inside `backup/`.  
**009, 010 and now 011 all do**, so it is the folder's practice and not this  
cut's slip. `backup/` is the record and is not read; changing that is a sweep  
across four files and a rule about what a retired document owes its reader, and  
it wants the owner rather than a plan cut.

---

## 2026-08-24 — 3TK-20: what this port decided, written where another port can read it

**Written: [3tk-port-findings-001.md](backup/3tk-port-findings-001.md).** Ten sections,  
the name the plan proposed, and **it recommends nothing.** `3tk/` and `src/` at  
the repository root are both untouched — the build run is the formality the plan  
called it, and it is **63 checks, 0 failed, four builds, 87 tests**.

**The shape held, and the trap the plan named in advance was real.** Every one of  
the six raw items has an obvious next sentence about what somebody ought to do,  
and the test that kept it out is the plan's own: *would this still be true if ztk  
never changed a line, and if dtk chose the opposite?* **The word *should* does  
not appear in the document at all** — not once, in any sense, which was not the  
target and is what the target produced. The only near-misses are the noun  
*recommendation*, in the two places that say the file contains none.

**Sections are ordered by structure and the document says so** — the item, the  
containers, the mailbox, the pool, the checking tiers, the helper, then what the  
port gets wrong, then what did not move. **No severity, no ranking, no  
defect-versus-cleanup split.** The late close and the mailbox anchor are peers,  
as the plan required.

**What the reading found, and none of it was in the plan's six items:**

- **ztk's pool is already last-in first-out.** `_add_returned_item` prepends —
  `pool.zig:561` — and every get takes the head: `pool.zig:576`, `:621`, `:276`.  
  The plan's item 6 said this was unread and to read it rather than assume; the  
  assumption available was that ztk was first-in first-out, since **3tk's own  
  code was**, and R11 is written as a reversal. **Two ports at the same order,  
  one by ruling with a recorded reason and one with no doc comment mentioning  
  order at all.** That is the finding, and drawing anything from it would have  
  been the thing the document may not do.
- **ztk's `Pool.close` already has R12's shape** — concat every per-tag list into
  one, clear, broadcast, hook outside the lock, `pool.zig:428-452`. R12 was  
  reached independently and is not a divergence.
- **The plan's own line numbers had drifted**, which is why verification 2 says
  *read rather than remembered*. `PolyHelper` is `polynode.zig:111`, not the  
  141-355 the plan carried; the late-close branch is `pool.zig:354`, not `:355`.  
  Two of the deviation audit's citations had drifted too — P4's leaver moved when  
  3TK-15 deleted the two unreachable `if (b)` guards. **Every `file:line` in the  
  document was printed and read before it was written down**, on both sides.

**The document quotes rather than restates, and the quotes were checked  
character by character against their sources** with the line wrapping normalized  
out. One bold emphasis had been added inside a D6 quotation and was removed:  
**a quotation that improves its source is not a quotation.**

**Three things went in that the plan did not list, each because a port reading  
004 alone would meet them and have nowhere to look:**

- **§9, what this port gets wrong and knows it.** P3 and P4 are open, and P3's
  own audit entry gives the reason it belongs in a document aimed at other ports:  
  *the next port will copy the shape before it checks its own backend.* It is  
  description with a citation and it prescribes nothing.
- **The `UNKNOWN_IDENTITY` question**, closed here by 3TK-15 and answered by ztk
  with `std.debug.assert(lists.contains(tag))` — `pool.zig:345`. The question is  
  every port's; the two answers are stated and neither is scored.
- **§6's pair of opposite verdicts on the same kind of evidence.** `put_all` was
  dropped for having no reason to exist and `push_back_slot` was kept though it  
  has no caller in `3tk/src/` at all, because its caller is the **put hook**,  
  which is application code. **The audit that measured both is the same audit**,  
  and a reader who saw only one of them would take the port for inconsistent.

**§8 is the one section that had to wait for 3TK-19**, and it did. `helper.c3`'s  
paragraph no longer warns a reader off a Part 7.1 conflict that 004 removed, so  
the section describes a closed question instead of quoting a live guard against a  
dead one. **The read-after-stale dependency was real and the ordering paid for  
itself.**

**Nothing else changed anywhere in the repository.** No code in any language, no  
edit to `../common/`, no `git` command, no stage declared in any line. **ztk's  
plan is the owner's to cut**, and this document is an input that terminates  
there.

---

## 2026-08-24 — 3TK-19: the three debts, and two of them were not repointings

**All three paid. No new document** — the stage is bookkeeping, and what it  
learned is this row. Four builds green at **63 checks**, **87 tests** in every  
mode, unchanged: doc comments and a markdown row move neither count.

**Debt 1 — two citations, and neither of them was a path edit.** 3TK-18 took  
`inner.c3:5` on the way past, so this stage inherited `mtk.c3:48` and  
`helper.c3:51`, and **both said something that 004 made false**, not merely  
something that pointed at a retired file.

- **`helper.c3:51` is the one the plan named, and it was right to.** The
  paragraph told the next reader *do not "fix" this file to match* Part 7.1,  
  and promised that *3TK-17 rewords it* — a rewording that had already  
  happened. **Rewritten, not repointed.** 004's Part 7.1 asks for *the members  
  of Part 7.2, specialized to that one type, generated from the type at compile  
  time*, and adds *how a port spells the generation is the port's business*  
  with **this port's macros named as one of the two realizations it shows.**  
  So the new paragraph says the file *is* Part 7.1 and there is nothing left to  
  reconcile. **The history is kept and demoted to a second paragraph**: the  
  conflict was real against 003, it was a SPECIFICATION defect and not a port  
  defect — E6, V19 — and a reader meeting this file next to 003 should be able  
  to see which way the correction ran. Repointing alone would have left a guard  
  arguing against a conflict that no longer exists.
- **`mtk.c3:48` was supposed to be the easy one and was not.** Its sentence
  read *Part 7.1 is a known SPECIFICATION defect against this port's shape —  
  V19, reworded by 3TK-17*. Repointed to 004 the file would have claimed a live  
  defect against the very document that closed it, in the present tense, one  
  clause after naming the stage that closed it. **Past tense, and it now says  
  what 004 did.** The plan called this a repointing; it was two sentences.

**The lesson, and it is debt 1's whole content: a stale citation and a stale  
claim wear the same clothes.** Both of these were found by grepping for `003`,  
and neither was fixed by editing `003`. **A `sed` would have finished this debt  
in one line and left both sentences wrong** — the same shape 3TK-15 met in A5,  
where the mechanical half was not the work.

**Zero occurrences of `matryoshka-specification-003` or `-002` anywhere in  
`3tk/src/`**, which is verification 1's real claim. **The literal claim — zero  
occurrences of `003` — is not reachable and was not attempted**, 3TK-18's  
verification 4 again. Twenty-three mentions of the string survive in six files  
and every one is history in the past tense: *003 deleted Part 8.6*, *003  
weakened the clause*, *002 said one internal base; 003 says what every container  
has*. **Rewriting those would falsify the record rather than repair it** — the  
port's doc comments argue from the specification's own history, and a version  
number inside that argument is a date, not a pointer.

**Debt 2 — P2 was one row, and it stayed one row.** The finding recorded a  
defect the port no longer has: `Pool.get` returning `NOT_AVAILABLE` from all  
three modes on an unknown identity, against Part 19.3's MUST. Assumption A3 was  
defaulted, **3TK-15 built it** — `mtk::UNKNOWN_IDENTITY`, deliberately outside  
Part 19's sets because Part 11.7 makes an identity the pool was not created with  
a caller defect and not a runtime condition — and `get_wait` took the same fault  
as a quality change. **Marked fixed in the audit's own vocabulary**: verdict  
stays **P**, scope stays `3tk-only`, because it moved the port and left Part  
19.3 and the specification untouched.

**The correction is P6's shape, not a rewrite** — a `RULED AND FIXED` blockquote  
at the head of the section, the finding left exactly as it was measured, and the  
evidence kept because the evidence is what makes the fix safe to read later.  
Three other places named the same row and all three were stale with it: the  
summary table's 19.3 row, and §5's open question 3, which still said *this is  
the only one of the four that leaves work behind*. **A finding lives in more  
than one place in this document**, and a correction that touches only the  
section leaves the table contradicting it. **No version bump** — 3TK-16's rule  
is one row, additively; one finding marked in the places that name it is still  
one row. V1 to V19 stand and nothing was re-argued.

**Debt 3 — otk, told at last, and the paragraph is a blockquote at the top of  
the only file it has.** `../odin/` holds `odin-to-zig-backport-001.md` and  
nothing else: no status file, no reference to the specification, and no way for  
a cold reader to learn the thing exists. 3TK-13 left it open and said so; 3TK-17  
did the same. **It names
[`../common/matryoshka-specification-004.md`](../common/matryoshka-specification-004.md)
as otk's normative input**, in the shape `../d/dtk-status.md` uses — ported from  
this file alone, defects fixed there once for every port, the four-port family  
named, the two moves and two recuts spelled out so the path is the only one to  
trust, and 004's change log named as the thing to read first.

**It also says what the file under it is not.** The document is an Odin-to-Zig  
idiom mapping whose Zig column is a proposal history overtook, and a reader who  
found it first could reasonably take it for otk's specification. That sentence  
is the reason the note goes at the top rather than in a new file.

**No status file was written for otk, and that is a decision the stage declined  
rather than one it made.** dtk's folder was prepared by a stage the owner named,  
with a scope ruling behind it; writing `otk-status.md` would mean answering what  
otk's line of work currently is, and **the stage's *may not* list is one  
paragraph.** The paragraph is additive, describes, and recommends nothing —  
whether otk is brought to the specification is left open in as many words.

**Nothing in `../common/` was touched, no `git` command was run, and `3tk/`'s  
behaviour is unchanged.** All three debts were on this side of the line.

**Next: 3TK-20**, which reads these doc comments. `helper.c3` is now right  
rather than merely repointed, and that was the whole reason for the order.

---

## 2026-08-24 — plan 011: what 3tk learned gets a stage

**Written: `3tk-staging-plan-011.md`.** 010 moved to  
`backup/`, and every link that named it was repointed — the status file twice,  
its superseded list, and this file's own 010 row. **Provenance keeps the name  
010; only the link target moved.** Nothing in `../common/` names a plan version  
later than 009, so nothing there needed touching.

**The only change is 3TK-20.** 3TK-0 to 3TK-19 are reproduced unaltered, and  
**3TK-19 stands declared and unstarted exactly as 010 left it** — it is not  
folded in and not reordered.

**Amended before this row was ever saved: 3TK-19 runs first.** The cut said the  
two were independent and could run in either order. They write no file in  
common, but **3TK-20 reads `3tk/src/` doc comments as an input and 3TK-19  
corrects one of them that is wrong.** `helper.c3:51` warns the reader off a  
Part 7.1 conflict that 004 removed and names a 3TK-17 rewording that has already  
happened; 3TK-20 is the next reader, and the helper surface is one of the  
differences it is most likely to describe. **A read-after-stale dependency, not  
a shared write** — which is why the first cut missed it. It is now written into  
the plan's ordering section, both stage sections, and the status file.

**Why 3TK-20 exists.** The redesign ruled R1 to R15 with reasons, and the  
reasons are spread across seven documents in this folder plus doc comments that  
appear in no document at all. **ztk and dtk are both strangers to every one of  
them.** dtk has run no stage and starts from 004 alone; ztk predates the  
redesign entirely. A reader who wants to know what this port does differently  
and why currently has to read the folder and assemble it.

**The stage was scoped by the owner in three rulings on 2026-08-24, and each one  
narrowed it:**

- **It is a 3tk plan and a 3tk document, not a new port line.** The first
  proposal was a `lang/zig/` folder with its own numbering; the owner refused  
  it. **What 3tk did stays 3tk's**, and a document of findings starts where the  
  work that produced it lives. The precedent was already here:  
  `ztk-audit-001.md` was 3TK-1's output and sat in this folder for twelve  
  stages, moving to `../common/` only when 3TK-17 proved it bound every port.  
  `3tk-deviations-001.md` is the same shape and is still here.
- **Description and reasoning. Not recommendations.** This is the ruling that
  decides what the file is for. A recommendation is a decision, and it is not  
  this port's to make — if the document says a port *should* do something, 3tk  
  has ruled for a port whose constraints are not 3tk's. **3tk was free to  
  redesign; ztk is the published reference with users**, and both R11's order  
  change and the late close alter promises ztk makes in writing. It also ages  
  badly: *3tk deleted `prev` because the required-operation audit found nothing  
  needed it* stays true permanently, and *ztk should delete `prev`* does not.  
  **dtk is what proves the shape** — a file of recommendations about ztk would  
  be worth nothing to a port that has run no stage, and a file of what 3tk  
  decided and why is exactly what it needs.
- **It is an input, and it terminates there.** ztk gets its own plan, cut by the
  owner, when and where they choose. 3TK-20 declares no stage in any line and  
  writes no code in any language. `src/*.zig` at the repository root is read and  
  never written.

**The plan carries the raw material rather than leaving it to be re-found** —  
six items, read out of both sources on 2026-08-24 and anchored at `file:line` on  
each side: the late close and 003's weakened MUST, the exact link test and the  
walk it deleted, D6's tiers and the difference between a removed check and an  
assumption, the mailbox's two queues against the anchor, what R15 and R3 dropped  
and what R6 refused, and one thing not yet read. **They are listed as material  
and not as an outline, and deliberately not ranked** — ranking by urgency is one  
of the shapes the no-recommendations ruling forbids.

**The trap is named in the stage.** Every one of the six items has an obvious  
next sentence about what somebody ought to do, and that sentence is the one  
thing the document may not contain. The test written into the plan: *would this  
still be true if ztk never changed a line, and if dtk chose the opposite?*

**One assumption is written in and marked as the stage's, not the owner's:** the  
document states ztk facts — *ztk does X here, 3tk does Y, and this is the  
reasoning that produced Y* — and draws no conclusion from the difference.  
Without that it is a 3tk changelog rather than something another port can use.  
**The owner may overrule it before the stage runs**, and the plan says so.

---

## 2026-08-24 — 3TK-18: the field is called `link`

**`Inner.next` is `Inner.link`.** Two words before, two words after. Four builds  
green at **63 checks**, **87 tests**, unchanged in every mode; sanitizers thread  
and address clean at 87. No new document — the ruling in
[3tk-any-options-001.md](backup/3tk-any-options-001.md) was already written, and the
diff says the rest.

**The permitted citation was taken.** `inner.c3:5` now names
[`../common/matryoshka-specification-004.md`](../common/matryoshka-specification-004.md).
**3TK-19 has two debts of the first kind left, not three** — `mtk.c3:48` and  
`helper.c3:51`, and `helper.c3:51` is still the one that matters.

**What the sweep taught, and it is why the row exists:**

- **The measurement was high.** The plan said 59 mentions, 35 of them field
  accesses, 18 of those in `queue.c3` and `stack.c3`. Counted after the fact:  
  **23 field accesses** — 2 in `inner.c3`, 12 in `queue.c3` and `stack.c3`, 9 in  
  the tests and `helper.c3` — out of 53 mentions of the word. The trap the plan  
  named was real and the arithmetic naming it was not. **Nothing followed from  
  the gap** except that a stage sized for 35 sites did 23.
- **`run-builds.sh` held a field access, and it is not one of the fourteen
  files.** Line 199 greps `src/mailbox.c3` and `src/pool.c3` for  
  `\.next[[:space:]]*=` to enforce Part 17.2 — *no container reaches around the  
  InnerQueue/InnerStack surface*. A rename that swept only `.c3` files would  
  have left that check hunting a field that no longer exists, **and it would  
  have gone on printing `ok` for ever.** Repointed to `.link`, and the line now  
  says which name it used to carry.
- **`unlink` does not exist.** The plan promised the sentence to `is_linked` and
  `unlink`; the repair of Part 8.8 is named `reset`. Both got it —  
  `h.link != null` reads in `is_linked`, and `reset` clears the link.
- **The iterator keeps its name.** `InnerQueueIterator.next()` is Part 8.4's
  walker and has nothing to do with the field. The stage renames one field and  
  may not touch the surface, so **verification 4's literal claim — zero `.next`  
  anywhere — is not reachable and was not attempted.** What is true is the  
  claim it was written for: **zero `.next` field accesses in `src/`, `test/`,  
  `negative/` and the scripts.**
- **One comment described the design that is gone.**
  `negative/insert_twice_same_queue.c3:6` explains the old Part 8.6 pair with  
  `prev == null && next == null` — two fields, neither of them current. A blind  
  rename there would have made the retired design read as though it had a  
  `link`. Reworded to name no field at all. The same file's *next* paragraph is  
  about the design that is here, and it says `link == this`.

**The four walk sites, each read against its own body:**  
`InnerQueueIterator.next` — comment `n.link == n`, code `n.link == n`.  
`InnerQueue.pop_front` — comment says the sole item is recognised by  
`head == tail` and not by a null link, code tests `self.head == self.tail`.  
`InnerQueue.append_queue` — comment says `other.tail` is already self-linked and  
needs no repair, code joins and does none. `InnerStack.pop` — the file header  
says the sole item is recognised by `h.link == h`, code tests `h.link == h`.

**`inner.c3` was rewritten by hand and read in full before the mechanical pass  
ran** — the folder's rule, and the one 3TK-11 paid for. Three mentions of  
`next` survive in it, all three in the paragraph that argues for the new name:  
the price of R6b is that the link carries two meanings, and `link` is the name  
that does not assert the wrong one. **No paragraph apologises for a name the  
file no longer uses.**

**No `any`, in any shape. No layout change, no behaviour change, no edit to  
`../common/`.** R6b, the exact link test and Part 8.6's deletion are untouched.

---

## 2026-08-24 — plan 010: the `any` ruling gets a stage, and so do the three debts

**Written: `3tk-staging-plan-010.md`.** 009 moved to  
`backup/`, and every link that named it was repointed — the status file, this  
file's own 009 row, and specification 004's provenance line in `../common/`.  
**Provenance keeps the name 009; only the link target moved.**

**009 was spent.** 3TK-0 to 3TK-17 had all run, `3tk/` was green at 63 checks  
and four builds, and nothing in the line was declared and unstarted. Two things  
were owed with no stage to run under, and 010 is exactly those two.

**3TK-18 — `Inner.next` becomes `Inner.link`.** The owner ruled `any` within  
`Inner` on 2026-08-24: **rejected in all three shapes, the rename accepted.**
[3tk-any-options-001.md](backup/3tk-any-options-001.md) carries the ruling and is the
stage's specification. The stage is the same shape as 3TK-11 and 3TK-16 — a  
ruled document, built — and it re-argues nothing. **The plan names the trap  
rather than leaving it to be discovered:** `queue.c3` and `stack.c3` hold 18 of  
the 35 field accesses, the four walk sites each state the end test in their own  
body, and `next` is a common English word that appears in prose which is not  
about this field. **Rewrite the exemplar first, then sweep** — the rule 3TK-11  
paid for. It writes no new document; the ruling is already written.

**3TK-19 — the three debts.** Stale 003 citations in `3tk/src/`, the stale P2  
row in the deviations audit, and otk never having been told the specification  
exists. **One stage because each alone is too small for a cold start**, and it  
runs after 3TK-18, which is permitted to take `inner.c3`'s citation on the way  
past since it rewrites that file's prose anyway. **`helper.c3:51` is the one  
that matters** — its guard tells the next reader not to "fix" the file to match  
Part 7.1, and 004 reworded Part 7.1 so the file now matches. That paragraph is  
rewritten, not repointed.

**Nothing in 010 touches `../common/`, and 004 stands as cut.** Part 4.2/V1  
already leaves the field count to the realization and 004's *3tk* line already  
reads *one link field plus the identity*, so the rename needs no specification  
change. **Neither stage blocks dtk**, which was freed by 3TK-17 and starts under  
its own plan in `../d/`.

---

## 2026-08-24 — 3TK-17: Part 7.1 states the promise, and 004 is cut for one Part

**Written: [`../common/matryoshka-specification-004.md`](../common/matryoshka-specification-004.md).**  
003 is in `../common/backup/`. **The first stage in this line permitted to edit  
`../common/`, and it edited one Part.**

**What was wrong.** Part 7.1 said *for each outer type there is a helper bound  
to that one type*. That is Zig's per-type comptime struct, written up as though  
it were the requirement. Of its three clauses only that one failed under the C3  
port: macro expansion is compile-time generation from the type, and the identity  
and the crossings still arrive together. **And Part 7.1's own closing sentence  
already set the floor lower** — a port with no compile-time generation writes  
the block by hand and *loses only the typing*. A port that generates but names  
no object sits above that floor on the thing the sentence says matters.

**004 states the promise**: for each outer type the members of Part 7.2 exist,  
specialized to that type, generated rather than hand-written, with the identity  
and the crossings from the one act of generation. Both realizations are shown,  
marked *ztk* and *3tk*, exactly as 003 did for the other fourteen. **A named  
per-type object is one spelling of it and not the rule.** One sentence was added  
that 003 never needed: *helper* is the document's word for the per-type surface,  
whatever a port calls it and wherever the generated code lives — because 7.2,  
7.3, 7.4 and 7.5 go on using the noun and none of them was touched.

**This is the fifteenth instance of 003's own theme, and 003 walked past it.**  
002 stated ztk's mechanism where the design has a promise in fourteen places and  
3TK-13 fixed all fourteen. Part 7.1 reads like a requirement, and nothing  
exposed it until a port answered the question a different way. **It is the first  
specification defect found since 003, and it was found by building, not by  
auditing** — 3TK-16 filed V19 against the Part while obeying neither it nor  
fixing it, and this stage is the one that could.

**The deciding argument was dtk, and dtk has been told.**
[`../d/dtk-status.md`](../d/dtk-status.md) gains a paragraph under its normative
inputs: D's idiomatic answer to *generate code per type* is templates and  
mixins — call-site expansion, the same shape as the C3 macro, not a per-type  
struct — so Part 7.1 as written would have set dtk the identical trap, and a  
second port would have re-derived this argument from cold. `d/inputs/README.md`  
and `../common/README.md` were repointed too.

**otk was not told, and that is recorded rather than closed.** `../odin/` holds  
one backport document, no status file and no reference to the specification.  
3TK-13 did not tell it either and said so. The question is still open and this  
stage does not close it silently.

**Nothing else was pending, and that was checked before the cut.** V1 to V18 are  
consumed by 003; V7b is recorded-not-fixed deliberately; A3's debt was code and  
3TK-15 paid it. No second defect was found, and the rule that produced V19 —  
*report it, do not fix it* — did not have to fire twice.

**`3tk/` was not touched**, and the paragraph in `src/helper.c3` telling the  
next reader not to "fix" the file to match Part 7.1 **is now stale and still  
stands**. So do `mtk.c3`'s and `inner.c3`'s citations of 003. Three doc  
comments, and this stage may write no code. Named here and in the status file's  
open questions.

---

## 2026-08-24 — 3TK-15: two debts paid, and one of them was misfiled

**Written: [3tk-debts-notes-001.md](3tk-debts-notes-001.md).** The last stage  
3TK-13 left owing. Both halves were decided before it started and neither was  
re-argued.

**A3 — the port broke a MUST in its own specification, and now does not.**  
`Pool.get` returned `NOT_AVAILABLE` for an identity the pool was not created  
with, from all three modes, where Part 19.3 reserves not-available for the  
available-only mode. A `@check` caught it in a checking build and expanded to  
nothing under `--safe=no` — D6 — so the fault was the observable behaviour of a  
fast build. The port now reports `UNKNOWN_IDENTITY`, a fault of its own,  
**deliberately not a Part 19 outcome**: Part 11.7 makes an identity outside the  
pool's set a caller defect rather than a runtime condition, which is the  
sentence the rest of that faultdef opens with. Part 19.2's sets are untouched.

**`get_wait` changed too, and it did not have to.** Its old fallthrough timed  
out, which Part 19.2 allows, so this half is a quality change and the notes mark  
it as one. Two reasons: the two gets must not disagree about one mistake, and a  
defect that costs the caller a full timeout to discover gets diagnosed as a  
performance problem instead of being fixed. One consequence — the early return  
made the loop's two `if (b)` guards unreachable, and they are removed rather  
than left as a reader's trap.

**The test is a runtime negative and could not have been a test-suite test.**  
A checking build aborts on the `@check` before any assertion runs, and  
`run-builds.sh` runs the suite in all four builds. The negative shape expects  
exactly that: abort where the checks are live, clean run where they are not.  
`negative/pool_unknown_identity.c3` asserts all three get modes plus `get_wait`,  
because *all three* was the whole of the defect. **It was measured to fail with  
the fix removed**, not asserted to. It also found that `@catch_is` belongs to  
the test runner and is unreachable from a negative program, which cost the first  
draft a compile.

**A5 was filed under the wrong noun, and that is the finding.** 003's own  
assumption A5 said the port *cites 002 in roughly forty doc comments*. **There  
was one** — `inner.c3:4` — because 3TK-16 had already repointed `mtk.c3` when it  
rewrote the header. What the port actually had was roughly ninety `Part N.N`  
citations, about sixty of them in Parts 003 changed. The debt was real and the  
grep was never going to find it. **The half A5 called *not mechanical* was all  
of the work**, and a `sed` would have found one line and declared victory.

**Twelve comments changed a claim rather than a path**, in five files, each one  
right about 002 and wrong about 003. Two are worth reading twice. `pool.c3:511`  
said Part 12.2's *called once* was *the one clause this bends* — 003 weakened  
12.2 for exactly this case and added Part 12.3 as a new MUST, so **the code now  
obeys the rule it was written to deviate from**, and the same comment still  
promised an answer *until 003 rules the shape*, written before 003 existed and  
left standing after it did. `pool.c3:233` cited Part 8.6 in the present tense  
for a technique it still uses correctly; the Part is a tombstone and the comment  
now says the technique has no Part left to cite.

**One thing left undone and named rather than done.** `3tk-deviations-001.md`'s  
P2 row is now stale — it records the defect A3 just fixed, and its section ends  
*the audit takes none* of the three answers. The stage's *may not* list does not  
forbid the edit, but 3TK-14's forbade it in the general form and **3TK-16 was  
granted its two rows explicitly rather than by inference**. A permission granted  
to the previous stage is not one this stage assumes. It wants a stage the owner  
names, and V19's treatment: additive, in the audit's own vocabulary.

**Green: `run-builds.sh` 63 checks — up from 59, the new negative adds one per  
build — `run-sanitizers.sh` 3 checks, 87 tests over four builds.** No occurrence  
of `matryoshka-specification-002` remains in `src/`, `test/` or `negative/`.  
Part 19.3 read against `pool.c3` clause by clause and reported conforming.

**`../common/` was not touched.** A3's whole point is that the specification is  
right and the port was wrong.

**Next: 3TK-17**, the last one, and it is the only stage that may touch  
`../common/`.

---

## 2026-08-24 — 3TK-16: the helper surface, in code

**Written: [3tk-helper-notes-001.md](3tk-helper-notes-001.md).** The mirror of  
3TK-11 — a ruled proposal, built, with no ruling of its own.

**The four accepted items landed.** H0 and H0b: `mtk::helper` and `mtk::owned`  
stop being generic modules and become ordinary ones carrying macros over  
`$Type`, plus `to`/`as`/`must`/`move` as methods on `Handle` and `Slot`. H5: the  
crossings are `to_handle`, `from_handle`, `must_from_handle`, `is_mine`, and the  
word *inner* keeps `Inner`, `inner_offset`, `src/inner.c3` and every line of  
prose. H10: `mtk::owned` is `mtk::managed`, `owned.c3` is `managed.c3`,  
`t_owned.c3` is `t_managed.c3`, and the fixture `struct Owned` is  
`struct Holder`.

**The number that says whether H0 worked is 35 to 0.** Thirty-five `alias`  
lines named the helper — twenty in `test/common.c3`, seven in  
`negative/common.c3`, eight across `mailbox.c3` and `pool.c3`. **There are none  
left, anywhere in `src/`, `test/` or `negative/`.** `test/common.c3` is now four  
struct declarations and a doc comment, and a new outer type costs nothing at all  
before it can be used.

**Green, and the counts are stated rather than inherited.** `run-builds.sh`: 59  
checks, 0 failed, four builds. **87 tests**, up from 85 — the stage added two,  
for M12's method surface, which is five new declarations doing address  
arithmetic and was exercised by nothing. `run-sanitizers.sh`: 3 checks, thread  
and address clean. All three `nocompile_*` negatives still refuse in every  
build and their messages still name the type.

**One line of `run-builds.sh` changed**, the `nocompile_managed_no_allocator`  
array key, exactly as the proposal measured: the expectation string is  
`mtk::helper`, the *alternative* the message names, so the rename left it  
untouched.

**Three edits to a finished stage's output, all additive.**
[3tk-deviations-001.md](3tk-deviations-001.md) gains **V19** — Part 7.1 is a
**specification** defect, scope `every port`, and the only verdict this stage  
changed, from C to S. Part 7.3's evidence moves from *two generic modules* to  
*two modules*. Parts 6.3 and 7.2 are repointed at the names H0 and H5 left.

**The named trap held.** Part 7.1 was wrong while the stage ran and the stage  
neither obeyed it nor fixed it. `../common/` is untouched; 3TK-17 rewords it.  
`src/helper.c3`'s header now carries a sentence telling the next reader not to  
"fix" the file to match a Part this folder has ruled defective — the guard  
comes out when 004 is cut.

**Three C3 spellings the proposal's scratch runs did not carry, found again  
here**: `$Type::typeid` and not `$Type.typeid`; `$Typeof(x)::typeid` and not  
`$typeof(x)::typeid`; and `to_handle(null)` is no longer writable at all,  
because the outbound crossing infers its type — it is `to_handle((Msg*)null)`,  
which is what the test always meant.

**And 3TK-11's warning earned its keep.** The rename ran on three axes and  
`inner` was never renamed — `to_inner`, `from_inner` and `must_from_inner` were  
rewritten one shape at a time so that `Inner` and `inner_offset` were  
untouchable by construction. **Four stale words survived the mechanical pass and  
were caught only by reading**, none of them a compiler error. Prose does not  
compile.

**Next: 3TK-15 — the two debts of 3TK-13, A3 and A5.** Then 3TK-17.

## 2026-08-24 — plan 009: 3TK-16 and 3TK-17 declared

**Written: `3tk-staging-plan-009.md`.** 008 moved to  
`backup/` and every link naming it was corrected in place, both directions: the  
live pointers in `3tk-status.md` name 009; the provenance lines in  
`3tk-helper-proposal-001.md` and this log keep naming 008 and now find it at  
`backup/`.

**Neither stage is authorized.** Both exist because 3TK-14 ended at a proposal  
and the owner ruled all twelve of its items the same day, and nothing carried  
those rulings anywhere.

**3TK-16 — the helper surface, in code.** The mirror of 3TK-11: a ruled proposal,  
built. It carries the four accepted items that change code — H0 and H0b, the  
helper becomes macros; H5, the crossings named for the *handle*; H10,  
`mtk::owned` becomes `mtk::managed` and the fixture becomes `struct Holder` —  
plus the **V19** row in `3tk-deviations-001.md` and one line of  
`run-builds.sh`. **They are one stage and not four because they land in the same  
two files**; splitting them means rewriting `helper.c3` and `owned.c3` three more  
times.

**Its named trap is unusual and worth recording: Part 7.1 will be wrong while  
the stage runs, and the stage must neither obey it nor fix it.** E6 ruled it a  
specification defect; 3TK-17 rewords it; 3TK-16 records V19 and leaves  
`../common/` alone. **A stage that "conforms" to a Part its own folder has ruled  
defective has un-ruled a ruling.**

**3TK-17 — Part 7.1 reworded, and specification 004.** The first stage in this  
line permitted to edit `../common/`, scoped to one Part. **V19 is the first  
specification defect found since 003 carried V1 to V18 — and it was found by  
building, not by auditing.** 003's fourteen came from an audit reading the  
specification against the port; this one came from a port answering a question  
a way the specification had not imagined. That is a different instrument and it  
is worth a paragraph in 004's change log.

**Its cost is named in the stage rather than discovered later: a whole  
specification version for one Part**, because the folder's rule is that every  
change makes a new file and the specification is on that list. 004 is therefore  
the cheap moment to batch any other specification change — and none is known.  
V1 to V18 are consumed by 003 and V7b was recorded-not-fixed deliberately. The  
stage re-checks that before cutting 004.

**The order is not the numbering, and plan 009 says so three times because it is  
the one thing to get wrong:**

```
3TK-16  (code)   →   3TK-15  (the debts)   →   3TK-17  (the specification)
```

**3TK-15 was declared first and runs third.** Plan 008 ordered it after 3TK-14  
because A5 repoints doc comments in the files 3TK-14 might rewrite. 3TK-14 ran  
and rewrote nothing — it proposed — so that ordering sentence is now satisfied on  
its face and **misleading**. Its own *What this stage may not do* already carried  
the right clause: *"if 3TK-14's proposal has been ruled and built by then, this  
stage runs on top of the result."* **The proposal is ruled and not built.** 009  
amends the section with a note above it and leaves the body unaltered, which is  
this folder's tombstone-in-place habit.

**3TK-17 has a constraint that points outside this folder: before dtk's first  
stage.** dtk has a prepared folder and no stage has run. D's idiomatic answer to  
*generate code per type* is templates and mixins — call-site expansion, the same  
shape as a C3 macro — so Part 7.1 as written sets dtk the identical trap it set  
3tk. Fixing it afterwards means a second port re-deriving this argument cold.

**One stale line was corrected while the plan was open.** The versioning section  
read *"this plan — `3tk-staging-plan-NNN.md`, currently 007"* — in 008, and in  
007 before it. It now reads 009, and says it was stale in both.

**Nothing is authorized.** Plan approval is not stage approval; that is a  
standing rule and it has not moved.

## 2026-08-24 — 3TK-14: the helper surface, measured then proposed, then re-measured against the stdlib

**Written: [3tk-helper-proposal-001.md](3tk-helper-proposal-001.md).** A  
proposal. **No file under `3tk/` was changed**, and no item is ruled.  
`run-builds.sh` 59 checks and `run-sanitizers.sh` 3 checks are green, trivially.

**The stage was written around one property of its input and that property paid  
off immediately.** [3tk-helper-alternatives.md](backup/3tk-helper-alternatives.md)  
ranks three shapes and then withdraws its own favourite. Measuring first meant  
finding out that **both** of its non-fallback shapes are unavailable in C3  
0.8.3, not just the one it doubted:

- A generic module cannot declare a method on its type parameter.
  `fn void Type.init(Type* self)` inside `module mtk::helper <Type>` gives  
  *`'Type' could not be found, did you spell it right?`* — the receiver name is  
  resolved as an ordinary type and a module parameter is not one. The note's  
  correction guessed this.
- An instantiated generic module cannot be aliased as a namespace.
  `alias MsgHelper = mtk::helper{Msg};` gives  
  *`'mtk::helper' could not be found`*, and so do three other spellings.  
  **A generic module is not a value and not a type.** It can be named only  
  through one of its declarations — which is the whole reason `test/common.c3`  
  carries one alias per operation, and no alias discipline was ever going to fix  
  it.

**The shape that survived is not in the note.** A generic module may declare a  
*struct*; that struct is generic over the module's parameter; methods hang on it  
normally and their bodies see `Type`. One alias to a `const` of it gives an  
application the entire surface in one line — `alias MSG = mtk::helper::OF{Msg};`  
and then `MSG.init(&m)`, `MSG.to_handle(&m)`, `MSG.from_handle(h)`. It was built  
against a scratch copy of the real `src/`, containers included, and sixteen  
behavioural assertions ran true in a checked build and under `-O3 --safe=no`.

C3 charged two small tolls and both are recorded: a zero-sized struct is not  
permitted, so the helper carries one unused byte in a compile-time constant; and  
an alias to a constant must be ALL-CAPS, so the call site is `MSG.init(&m)` and  
cannot be `msg.init(&m)`.

**Two of the note's opinions did not survive contact with the port.**

The note says keep `TYPE` private, because `is_mine(h)` is the public form of  
the test. True of the crossing, false of the port: **the pool is keyed on the  
identity.** `Pool.create(a, typeid[] tags, ...)`, `Pool.get(typeid want, ...)`,  
`Pool.count_of(typeid)` are all application API, `OWNED_TYPE` is read at 46 call  
sites in `test/`, and two negative tests are built out of `MSG_TYPE` and  
`JOB_TYPE`. An application that cannot name its type's identity cannot create a  
pool. Part 7.2's first member is a *value*, not a predicate.

The note's `OFF` argument — the one the plan flagged as the item touching  
conformance rather than taste — is right in direction and overstated in effect.  
**`mtk::inner_offset` is public at `src/inner.c3:238` and application code can  
do the arithmetic through it today.** That was compiled; it compiles. And it  
cannot be closed, because C3's `@private` is module-scoped and `mtk::helper` is  
a submodule — the same property `run-builds.sh`'s layering checks already rely  
on. So **Part 7.5's MUST is held by convention, review and the layering checks,  
not by visibility, and it always was.** Hiding `OFF` is still proposed, on the  
narrower claim that it removes two alias lines and leaves one file naming an  
offset, with the limit written into the doc comment.

**One check the stage was told to run came back *conforms*.** The note says  
`move_from_slot` should validate before it consumes. It already does —  
`helper.c3:122-126` peeks, tests, and only then takes, so Part 9.2 rule 4 holds  
on the mismatch path. What is left is smaller: the returned pointer is computed  
from `take()`'s result rather than from the handle `peek` saw, an invisible  
dependency on `Slot.take`. One extra line removes it.

**And one was decided against the note by Part 15.5.** Splitting  
`must_from_handle`'s single `@check` into null and wrong-type buys a message and  
costs a branch, and both cases are the same kind of wrong — a contract  
violation, compiled out together in a fast build. Rejected, with the reason to  
go in the doc comment so it does not come back.

**A number in the plan was wrong and is corrected here.** `test/common.c3`  
carries **twenty** alias lines, not seventeen. Under the proposal it carries  
eight — and the figure that matters is the slope, not the total: a new outer  
type costs one line instead of nine, an owning type two.

**`owned` is answered and D10 is not reopened.** `mtk::owned` takes the same  
shape and composes the helper through the instance. Two generic modules stay two  
generic modules; `owned` simply stops re-declaring `OFF`, which it already never  
read.

**One question is left open and named as one.** Whether `mtk::inner_offset`  
should be harder to reach at all is a question about the port's *module  
structure* — `mtk::helper` inside `mtk` rather than beside it — and that touches  
the Part 17.2 layering checks. The stage did not answer it.

## The second input, and it changed the answer

**Mid-stage the owner said: read `std::collections::interfacelist`,  
`std::collections::anylist`, and possibly another sources in std.** That advice  
is why this proposal has an H0.

C3's core already carries Part 6.3's two crossings, for its own type-erased  
value, and it does **not** generate a helper object per type for them.  
`core/builtin.c3:111-134`:

```c3
macro anycast(any v, $Type) { if (v.type != $Type) return TYPE_MISMATCH~; return ($Type*)v.ptr; }
macro any.to(self, $Type)   // the checking crossing
macro any.as(self, $Type)   // the asserting crossing, as a @require contract
```

Read against Part 7.2 it is the same design: a stored `typeid` compared against  
a type name — that is `is_mine` — and two crossings named apart, `to` and `as`.  
**The type is an argument at the call site. There is no instantiation and no  
alias.** `interfacelist.c3:7-29` and `anylist.c3:21` show the other half of the  
lesson: the stdlib *does* reach for a generic struct inside a generic module,  
with `typedef AnyList = inline InterfaceList {any};` naming one instantiation —  
but it reaches for it for a **container**, which has state. **The helper has no  
state.** Its `Helper` struct under H1 exists only to hang methods on, carries  
one unused byte, and forces an ALL-CAPS alias per type.

So the stage proposes H0: `mtk::helper` becomes an ordinary module of macros  
over `$Type`, with `to`, `as`, `must` and `move` as methods on `Handle` and  
`Slot`.

```c3
mtk::helper::init(&m);                 // type inferred, no argument
Handle h = mtk::helper::handle_of(&m); // type inferred

Msg* p = h.to(Msg);
Msg* q = h.as(Msg);
Msg* c = s.move(Msg);
```

**No application writes an alias for any type, ever.** Measured against the real  
`src/` with the containers in place: zero errors, seventeen behavioural  
assertions true including a live mailbox round trip, identical under  
`-O3 --safe=no`, and the eight file-local alias lines in `mailbox.c3` and  
`pool.c3` deleted rather than repointed. `test/common.c3` goes from twenty alias  
lines to none and keeps only its four structs.

**`@require` turned out to be D6's tier 2, natively.** The asserting crossing as  
a doc-comment contract aborts in a safe build — naming the violated condition  
*and the caller's line*, which `mtk::@check` does not — and compiles out  
entirely under `--safe=no`. It also repairs the macro shape's one real weakness:  
an untyped boundary. Passing an `int*` to `handle_of` gives  
*`@require "$defined($Typeof(*item)::members)" violated: 'handle_of wants a  
pointer to a struct that embeds an Inner'`*, at the caller's line, in the port's  
own words.

**One measurement in this stage was wrong and is recorded rather than quietly  
fixed.** That guard was first written `$Typeof(*item).members`, with a dot. It  
compiled, and it rejected *every* type, valid ones included — and because only  
the negative case was run, it read exactly like a guard that worked. `::`, not  
`.`. Both directions are verified now. A guard that always fires is  
indistinguishable from a guard that works until you test the happy path.

**H0's cost is one sentence in the specification and the stage will not spend  
it.** Part 7.1 SHOULD says *for each outer type there is a helper bound to that  
one type, generated at compile time from the type.* Under H0 there is no  
per-type helper object; the code is generated per call site. Every Part 7.2  
member is present, every crossing is still in one file, and Part 7.1's own next  
line says the shape is fixed and generation is the convenience — but the  
sentence stops describing the port. **Accepting H0 means either recording a  
deviation or rewording Part 7.1 in `../common/`, and 3TK-14 was allowed to touch  
neither.** H0b carries a second, smaller one: today a type declares itself  
owning by being instantiated as `mtk::owned{Type}`; under H0b any caller may  
call `mtk::owned::create` on any type with an `Allocator` field. Part 7.3  
permits *a separate name* as the means, so the rule holds — whether the port  
wants the weaker guarantee is a ruling, and D10's *spelling* moves with it.

**H1 to H3 stand as the alternative** if H0 is rejected. They were measured  
first, against the same `src/`, and they are the best shape available without  
macros.

## Ruled the same day, and one item added

**The owner accepted H0 and H0b.** The helper becomes macros; `mtk::owned`  
follows and carries D10's spelling with it. H1 to H3 are withdrawn — they are  
kept unedited in the proposal as the record of what the port would have looked  
like without macros. H4, H6, H8 and H9 turned out to be settled or forced by H0  
rather than separate decisions, and H7 stands as recommended.

**H5 was accepted the same day, and the evidence for it was better than the  
proposal's first draft of it.** The stage had argued H5 as a close call against  
R1, which had renamed `to_any` → `to_inner` one day earlier. Reading what R1  
actually ruled dissolved the objection. Its table,  
`3tk-core-redesign-proposal-002.md:174` and `:182`:

```
| `AnyHandle`           | **`Handle`**   | Still a transparent alias for `Inner*`. D4 stands |
| `mtk::helper::to_any` | **`to_inner`** | An inherited name, and it now says the direction  |
```

**The stated reason is the direction prefix, not the noun — and the same pass,  
in the same table, kept *handle* for the type.** The noun was picked  
mechanically to match `Inner` while de-`Any`-ing the port. `inner` against  
`handle` was never the question that day. **So H5 finishes R1 rather than  
reversing it**, and the *this was ruled yesterday* objection does not survive  
reading the ruling. *inner* keeps `Inner`, `inner_offset`, `src/inner.c3` and  
the prose; it stops naming a handle, which is a `Handle` in every signature that  
returns or takes one.

**And the stage had to correct its own spelling to accept it.** M11 to M13 were  
measured with `handle_of(&m)` — this stage's invention, in neither the note nor  
R1 — which drops the direction prefix that was R1's entire stated reason and  
breaks the symmetry with `from_handle`. The accepted member is `to_handle`.

**The probes were re-run rather than the document edited.** Renaming a thing  
inside your own quoted compiler output is no longer quoting, and this line of  
work has one rule it inherited from 3TK-4: every claim about the language is a  
program that ran. Seventeen assertions true under the new spelling, zero errors,  
identical under `-O3 --safe=no`, and both quoted diagnostics re-verified.

Two lessons are worth keeping, and they are the same lesson twice. **A  
measurement made under an unruled assumption carries the assumption into the  
ruling** — H0 was measured with names H5 had not yet decided. And **a guard that  
always fires is indistinguishable from a guard that works, if you only run the  
negative case** — the `$Typeof(*item).members` slip earlier in this stage. Both  
were caught by running the other half.

**H10 was added on the owner's question — is it time to replace `owned` with  
`managed`?** The specification never uses either word, so nothing constrains it.  
The argument for `managed`: `owned` is passive and invites *owned by whom?*,  
where the answer is nobody — D3 has the item keep **its own** allocator. The  
port's own prose already draws the contrast, at `owned.c3:13`: *takes  
`mtk::helper` and manages its own lifetime.* And the family argument — the only  
place the vocabulary appears in the whole corpus is Zig's, at  
`ztk-audit-001.md:264`, where `Unmanaged` means precisely *does not keep its  
allocator*, which is Part 13.1 inverted.

**The argument against is a cross-port one and it does not go away:** `managed`  
carries garbage-collector baggage, and **dtk is scoped `@nogc`**, so the word  
misfires for exactly one of the four ports. The stage recommends `managed`  
anyway, with one sentence of doc comment aimed at the D and C# reader — cheaper  
than choosing a weaker word to prevent a misreading that a sentence prevents.

**The fixture is a separate question and H10 says so.** `struct Owned` is a test  
type, declared twice and read at 34 sites, and it exists to prove one property —  
*carries an Allocator*. Its three siblings are named for what they prove, not  
for what they use. Recommended: `struct Holder`, which stays true whatever the  
module is called.

**On timing, which is what was actually asked: inside the code stage that  
carries H0b, not before it and not alone.** H0b rewrites `owned.c3` from  
scratch, 3TK-15's A5 repoints doc comments in the same files, and the file's  
25-line header is prose about D3 and D10 that a rename touches anyway. One pass  
instead of three. Every one of the ~93 sites is compiler-caught, with 3TK-11's  
warning still standing: rename on word boundaries and read the diff.

**H10 was accepted the same day, recommendation and sub-question together.**  
`mtk::owned` becomes `mtk::managed`; the test fixture `struct Owned` becomes  
`struct Holder`. The fixture was the part the stage argued separately — it is a  
test type that exists to prove one property, *carries an Allocator*, and its  
three siblings are named for what they prove rather than for what they use.  
`Holder` stays true whatever the module is called.

**The GC connotation is paid for with one sentence, not with a weaker word.**  
`managed` reads .NET to some readers, and **dtk is scoped `@nogc`** — it is the  
port that would meet the word wrong. The module's doc comment will say that  
*managed* here is Zig's sense: the item keeps its allocator and releases itself  
with the kept one, Part 13.1, with no collector and no runtime anywhere in the  
toolkit. Choosing a weaker word to prevent a misreading that a sentence prevents  
is the worse trade.

**The rename was measured after the ruling, not assumed, and it turned up one  
thing worth having checked.** `run-builds.sh:71` keys the compile-time negative  
for an allocator-less type on a literal string. The message at  
`src/inner.c3:274` names **both** modules — *use `mtk::helper` instead of  
`mtk::owned`* — so the rename moves only its second half and **the expectation  
string `mtk::helper` survives untouched**. The harness check passes without  
being edited.

**Filenames were the only live edge, and they are small.** `test/t_owned.c3` is  
free — `c3c test` discovers the suite, and no script names the file.  
`negative/nocompile_owned_no_allocator.c3` is not free: it is a hard-coded key  
at `run-builds.sh:71`, driven from `:161`. Renaming it costs exactly one line,  
and the word in it names the module you tried to use, so leaving it stale is  
worse. **That one line is the whole of what the harness needs for H0, H0b, H5  
and H10 together** — and Part D's earlier flat claim that `run-builds.sh` does  
not change was written before H10 existed and is corrected in place.

## E6 and E7, ruled — and they came out asymmetrically

**E6 — Part 7.1 is a specification defect, not a port deviation.** Of its three  
clauses, only *"for each outer type there is a helper bound to that one type"*  
fails under H0. The other two — *generated at compile time from the type*, and  
*carries the identity and the crossings* — are true. And Part 7.1's own closing  
sentence sets the floor **below** where H0 sits: *a port with no compile-time  
generation writes the same block by hand for each type, and loses only the  
typing.* Hand-written blocks are conformant. H0 generates; what it lacks is a  
**named per-type object**, which is a mechanism and not a promise.

**That failing clause is ztk's mechanism, and this is exactly the disease 3TK-13  
was created to cure.** 002 was written from ztk and stated Zig's mechanism where  
the design has only a promise, in fourteen places. 003 fixed fourteen. **Part  
7.1 is the fifteenth and 3TK-13 missed it.** Worth recording plainly, because  
the audit that produced 003 was thorough and still walked past this one — the  
sentence *reads* like a requirement, and only a port that answers the question  
differently exposes it as a mechanism. **3tk is that port. The gap did not show  
until something tried to fill it another way.**

**The deciding argument was dtk, and it is the argument that moved the  
specification into `../common/` on 2026-08-23.** No stage has run there. D's  
idiomatic answer to *generate code per type* is templates and mixins —  
call-site expansion, the same shape as a C3 macro, not a per-type struct.  
Rewording Part 7.1 inside this consumer's folder would leave the identical trap  
set for D and for Odin behind it.

So it is an **S**, scope `every port`, in the vocabulary  
`3tk-deviations-001.md` already uses — V1, V2 and V3 are the precedent and 003's  
change log shows how a V is consumed. **Not a P.** A P would record the port as  
wrong where the specification overreached, and keeping those apart is the whole  
value of that audit.

**E7 — nothing is lost, and the stage's own premise was wrong.** It had raised  
E7 as *the owning distinction stops being a property of the type*. It was never  
a property of the type in 3tk. `struct Owned` carries no marker, and  
`src/owned.c3:5` says why: *"ztk spells this distinction with a marker constant  
and pays 110 duplicated lines; C3 has no property to branch on and needs  
neither."* **D10 had already moved the decision off the type** — an  
instantiation is a declaration the *application* writes, not a permission the  
type grants. H0b moves it from the alias line to the call line; both are on the  
application's side of the fence. The build-time gate survives, measured under  
the H10 rename: *type Plain has no Allocator field; use mtk::helper instead of  
mtk::managed.* **No change to anything.**

A small lesson, and it is the third of its kind in this stage: **a question  
raised as a risk is still a claim, and it has to be checked like one.** E7 read  
as a real loss until the fixture was actually opened and found to declare  
nothing.

## What is owed, and the one gap

**3TK-14 could write none of the following and did not.** The code stage owes:  
the S/V row for Part 7.1 and the updated Part 7.3 row in  
`3tk-deviations-001.md` — which is 3TK-12's output, and a stage may not rewrite  
a finished stage's output; one line of `run-builds.sh` for the renamed  
`nocompile_` file; the GC sentence in `managed.c3`; and E7's call-site sentence.

**The gap: rewording Part 7.1 in `../common/` has no stage.** Plan 008 declares  
3TK-14 and 3TK-15 and nothing else, and no stage may touch `../common/`. The  
edit is small — state the promise, show both realizations marked *ztk* and  
*3tk*, as 003 did for the other fourteen — but it needs to be declared, and it  
wants to run **before dtk's first stage**, not after.

**Every H item is ruled, E6 and E7 are ruled, and nothing is authorized.** H0,  
H0b, H5 and H10 all land in one code stage alongside 3TK-15's A5 — one pass  
instead of five. No code stage has been named.

---

## 2026-08-24 — plan 008: 3TK-14 and 3TK-15 declared

**Written: `3tk-staging-plan-008.md`.** 007 moved to  
`backup/` and every link naming it was corrected in place, both directions: the  
live pointers in `3tk-status.md` name 008; the provenance lines in  
`3tk-deviations-001.md`, `../common/matryoshka-specification-003.md` and this  
log keep naming 007 and now find it at `backup/`.

**Neither stage is authorized.** Both were named by the owner after 3TK-13  
reported.

**3TK-14 — the helper surface, re-thought.** The first stage in this line whose  
subject is the *surface* and not the semantics. `helper.c3` was written in 3TK-6  
and has not been questioned since; an application reaches it through one alias  
per operation, and `3tk/test/common.c3` carries **seventeen alias lines** to use  
four types. The shape is conformant — Part 7.1 leaves the spelling to the port —  
so nothing requires this and the owner named it anyway. `owned` rides along as a  
second question.

**Its input is the owner's `3tk-helper-alternatives.md`, and the stage is written  
around one property of that file: it withdraws its own favourite.** The note  
ranks three shapes, calls methods-on-the-generic-type-parameter its clear  
favourite, and then a later *Important correction* section says that is probably  
not legal C3 and must not be relied on without a compiler test. A stage that  
implements the ranking without reading to the end implements something that does  
not compile. **So 3TK-14 measures with c3c first and designs second** — the  
3TK-4 shape, where every claim about the language is a program that ran with its  
output quoted. It ends at a proposal and touches no code.

**One item in that note is about conformance and not taste, and it is called out  
separately**: exporting `OFF` hands application code the address arithmetic Part  
7.5 MUST confines to the helper, and `MSG_OFF` is aliased in `test/common.c3`  
today.

**3TK-15 — the two debts of 3TK-13.** A3 and A5, both already ruled, gathered so  
they are paid rather than drifting. **It runs after 14**, because A5 repoints doc  
comments in the files 14 may rewrite — running it first would repoint comments  
that 14 then rewrites.

**A3 is a real defect and worth naming plainly**: `Pool.get` answers  
`NOT_AVAILABLE` for an identity the pool was not created with, from every mode,  
where Part 19.3 says that outcome comes only from the available-only mode. The  
`@check` above it expands to nothing under `--safe=no`, so this is the observable  
behaviour of a fast build. **The port currently breaks a MUST in its own source  
of truth, knowingly, and has since 3TK-13 chose to leave 003 untouched.** A5 is  
bookkeeping by comparison, with one part that is not mechanical: where 003  
changed the rule a comment cites, the comment's claim changes too, and a comment  
citing Part 8.6 is citing a deleted Part.

## 2026-08-24 — the two scripts take an optional directory

**Not a stage.** A tooling change on the owner's instruction, after 3TK-13  
reported. No document of record changed and nothing in `3tk/src/`,  
`3tk/test/` or `3tk/negative/` was touched.

Both `run-builds.sh` and `run-sanitizers.sh` opened with `cd "$(dirname "$0")"`,  
so each always ran against the directory it lived in. Each now takes an optional  
first argument naming the directory to run against. **Absent or empty falls  
through to `$(dirname "$0")` — the same expression that was already there** — so  
every existing invocation, every line of `3tk-status.md` and the cold-session  
gate behave identically. One site changed per script.

**The `cd` is now guarded, and that is the part worth recording.** Neither script  
sets `-e`. A failed `cd` therefore did not stop them: the body would have run in  
whatever directory the caller happened to be in, and `run-builds.sh` removes its  
temporary directory with `rm -rf` at exit. While the target was always  
`dirname "$0"` that was unreachable in practice; a caller-supplied path makes it  
reachable, so it had to become fatal. A bad path prints one line and exits 2  
with nothing else run.

**Verified, all four cases on both scripts**: no argument from an unrelated  
working directory, an empty argument, an explicit directory, and a path that  
does not exist. `run-builds.sh` 59 checks 0 failures on each of the first three,  
`run-sanitizers.sh` 3 clean runs on each, and exit 2 with no work done on the  
fourth.

**A note on how it was verified, because the first attempt was wrong.** Three  
full passes of `run-builds.sh` cost roughly ten minutes and mostly proved that  
c3c works; the three cases differ only in which directory the script lands in.  
The cheap check written to replace it piped the script's prologue into `bash -s`  
and was **invalid**, because that changes `$0` — the one variable under test —  
and it reported the no-argument case landing in the caller's directory. The full  
runs were the honest evidence and they passed. **A test that alters `$0` cannot  
test `dirname "$0"`.**

## 2026-08-24 — 3TK-13: specification 003, and the gap closes

**Written: `../common/matryoshka-specification-003.md`.** The first stage of  
this plan to write into `../common/`, and the whole of its risk was that the  
file binds dtk and otk with no stage running on either to catch a mistake.

**Eighteen changes, and fourteen of them are one mistake made repeatedly.** 002  
was written from ztk, and where it described a *mechanism* it described Zig's as  
though it were the rule. Those Parts now state the promise and show both  
realizations side by side, marked *ztk* and *3tk* — 4.2, 8.1, 8.2, 8.7, 11.2,  
11.3, 11.7, 11.8, 12.2, 12.5 and the four Parts the forecast said were  
untouched, 19.1, 19.2, 20, 21 and 22. A reader of 003 cannot mistake either  
realization for the rule, which is the failure 002 could not prevent because it  
had only one.

**Four changes are not that**, and each is worth naming:

- **Part 12.3 gains a MUST that did not exist.** What the pool does with a
  hook's result if the pool closed while the hook ran: re-read the flag, and  
  send what the call is holding to the close hook. This is the rule P1 fell  
  through, and every port has the same window because every port unlocks across  
  the hook. Invariant 35.
- **Part 12.2's *called once* is weakened** to *called once by close, and once
  more per straggling put*. **The only thing 003 weakens**, and the alternative  
  — handing the items back to the caller — has no channel for the parts the  
  caller never had. It is named twice in the change log so nobody meets it by  
  accident.
- **The pool's *put a list* is deleted**, from Part 11.7 and from Part 19.2's
  table. Its mid-batch failure mode was the one case with no clean answer.
- **Part 8.6 is deleted and tombstoned in place.** An exact link test makes the
  O(n) walk catch nothing. A port that does not reach an exact test still writes  
  the walk — under 8.7, where the price is now stated, not under a Part that no  
  longer exists.

**Nothing renumbered.** Assumption A1 held all the way through: Part 8.6 is a  
tombstone, invariant row 16 says it was retired and 16b replaces it, row 35 is  
new. Roughly forty doc comments in `3tk/src/` cite Part numbers by hand and none  
of them broke.

**No 3tk-only finding reached `../common/`.** That was the split's whole  
purpose. Parts 2.6 and 19.3 are unchanged and the port fails both — P4 and P2 —  
because moving a rule to accommodate a port's defect is how a specification  
stops being one.

**Filing, assumption A5.** 002 moved to a new `../common/backup/`, beside 001,  
and its own two outbound links were fixed for the new depth. Every document that  
named 002 was repointed: the live pointers — `common/README.md`,  
`../d/dtk-status.md`, `../d/inputs/README.md`, this folder's status — now name  
003; the provenance mentions in stage outputs, logs and backups keep naming 002  
and now find it at `backup/`. Both directions, in place.

**dtk was told.** One paragraph in `../d/dtk-status.md` says its input changed  
and why it matters to a port that has not started: a dtk written from 002 would  
have reproduced `prev`, the anchor, the general list and an inexact link test,  
and then needed 3TK-10 and 3TK-11 run again against it. **otk was not told** —  
it has no stage and 3TK-13 was not permitted to touch it.

**Two debts, both recorded rather than paid.** A3: the P2 code change is not  
made, so Part 19.3's MUST is currently unmet by the port. A5: `3tk/src/` still  
cites 002 in its doc comments. Both are in 003's change log and in the status  
file, so neither is a surprise.

`3tk/run-builds.sh` 59 checks, green — nothing in `3tk/` was touched.

---

## 2026-08-24 — five questions before the cut, five defaults recorded

**No code, no documents rewritten.** `3tk-status.md` gains *The assumptions  
3TK-13 starts from*, and the audit's four open questions close.

The owner was asked, before clearing for 3TK-13, whether any question would help  
the stage, and answered five with *take all recommendations, record them as  
assumptions*. **The distinction is the point**: a ruling is the owner's  
judgment, an assumption is a default the stage proceeds on, and 003's change log  
will mark each as the second so a later reader can overturn one without working  
out whether they are contradicting a decision.

**A1 — Parts do not renumber; a deleted Part becomes a tombstone.** The largest  
of the five, and the reason is arithmetic rather than taste: Part numbers are  
cited by hand in the D-register, the R-register, the notes, the audit and around  
forty doc comments in `3tk/src/`. Renumbering after 8.6's deletion would  
silently invalidate every one of them. Part 18's invariant table already works  
this way — row 16 is retired, not removed — so the convention exists and is  
being extended rather than invented.

**A2 — the *ztk* lines stay and *3tk* lines join them where the ports differ.**  
The audit's central finding is that a Zig mechanism was read as the rule. Two  
realizations side by side is what stops the next reader making that mistake in  
either direction, and it is cheap while both ports are fresh. The cost is  
length.

**A3 — P2 is answered in the port, and it is the only default that leaves work  
behind.** `Pool.get` should report a distinct outcome for an identity the pool  
was not created with, rather than `NOT_AVAILABLE`, so Part 19.3's *only* keeps  
its MUST and 003 stays untouched. **3TK-13 does not make that change** — it is a  
document stage — so it wants its own small stage or folding into the next code  
one. Recorded so it is not lost.

**A4 — Part 6.5's dispatch table is the application's**, said in one sentence.  
Every clause in 6.5 describes application code. On that reading 3tk had nothing  
to ship, so P5 stops being a skipped SHOULD with no written why and closes with  
V18.

**A5 — filing and scope.** 002 goes to a new `../common/backup/`, because the  
specification lives in `common/` now and `c3/backup/` is the C3 line's own  
record. **The port's doc comments are not repointed** from 002 to 003: forty  
edits would bury a document stage, so it becomes a later stage's work and 003's  
change log states it as a known debt rather than leaving it to surprise someone.  
One line goes into `../d/dtk-status.md`, because dtk has run no stage and 003 is  
what it has been waiting for.

**3TK-13 now has nothing left to wait on.** All eighteen every-port rows have  
their replacement named, V11's three clauses included.

*Advice on clear: clear now, then run 3TK-13. Its inputs are the audit, the  
specification and this file.*

---

## 2026-08-24 — P1 fixed: the pool no longer loses items to a close

**The audit's most serious finding, ruled and repaired the same day.** Changed:  
`3tk/src/pool.c3`, `3tk/test/t_concurrency.c3`. All four builds green, 59  
checks, all three sanitizer runs clean, **85 tests**.

**The defect, in one paragraph.** Part 12.3 MUST forbids holding the pool's  
mutex across a call into application code, so `Pool.put` releases it around  
`on_put`. A `Pool.close` can therefore run to completion inside that window: set  
both flags, drain every bucket, hand everything to `on_close`. The old `put`  
then relocked and pushed onto a shelf that had just been emptied, in a pool that  
was already down. **The item was with nobody.** `slot.take()` cleared the  
caller's Slot before the hook ran, so Part 9.4 told the caller truthfully that  
the pool had it; the close hook had already run, so it never saw it. Invariant  
34 and Part 11.8 both broke on the one window. The mailbox has no equivalent —  
`send` holds the mutex from the closed test to the enqueue.

**The owner ruled the mechanism first: re-read the closed flag after the hook.**  
That left the destination open, and the audit had already recorded why neither  
candidate was legal under 002 — a second `on_close` is forbidden by Part 12.2's  
*called once*, and handing the items back to the caller has no channel for the  
`extra` parts, which the caller never had and which would leak instead.

**Then the owner ruled the destination: the stragglers go to `on_close`, and a  
second call is acceptable.** So the pool's rule is now one line — *what the pool  
holds when it discovers it is closed goes to the close hook* — and it keeps  
invariant 34 and Part 11.8 intact while bending exactly one clause. **A hook  
must not destroy its own state on the first `on_close`.** The owner's reason,  
plainly: two calls to cleanup beats leaked parts.

**The test was checked both ways, and that is the part worth recording.** The  
audit found P1 by reading, and a defect found by reading is one the suite does  
not provoke — the same class as the missed leaver's signal that 3TK-11's notes  
recorded as untested. `a_close_during_the_put_hook_loses_nothing` makes it  
deterministic: the put hook parks until a second thread has closed the pool and  
returned, so the window is held open rather than raced for. With the fix removed  
it fails on `Violated assert 'p.count_of(OWNED_TYPE) == 0': invariant 34: an  
item is in a closed pool`. A test that passed either way would have been the  
failure mode `run-builds.sh` already records for `release_open_pool`.

The hook waits, which Part 12.3 tells a hook not to do. That is the test being a  
test: it is the only way to hold the window open without calling back into the  
pool from the hook, which is the other half of the same contract. Both the kept  
item and two `extra` parts are asserted to reach the close hook.

**V11 stops being a question.** The audit's one undetermined row — *what the  
pool does with a hook's result when the pool closed while the hook ran* — now  
has three clauses for 003 to write, and the third is the only place 003 weakens  
an existing MUST: Part 12.2's *called once* becomes *once by close, and once  
more per straggling put*. It is every-port because clause 1 is forced by Part  
12.3, which every port obeys, so every port has the same window. **All eighteen  
every-port rows now have their replacement named, and 3TK-13 has nothing left to  
wait on.**

*Advice on clear: clear before 3TK-13. The audit is its input; this repair is  
recorded in it.*

## 2026-08-24 — 3TK-12: the audit found what a forecast could not

Written: [3tk-deviations-001.md](3tk-deviations-001.md). **No code touched, and  
`../common/` untouched.** `3tk/run-builds.sh` and `3tk/run-sanitizers.sh` were  
run at the start of the stage and are green — 59 checks, 3 sanitizer checks, 85  
tests over four builds — which is the trivial result the plan expected and is  
recorded so the document says which code it measured.

**96 elements across Parts 1 to 22. 74 conform, 17 specification-should-move, 5  
port-should-move, 8 not applicable.**

**The stage exists because §8.1 was a forecast, and the forecast was  
incomplete.** Nine of its ten rows stand as written. What it missed is one  
pattern repeated five times: a Part that never mentions the list still *points*  
at one. Part 19.2 carries a row for `put a list`. Part 20 carries two open  
decisions that Part 8.6's deletion answers or voids. Part 21's Q11 points at the  
deleted Part 8.6. Part 22's step 5 names two insert checks where there is one.  
§8.1's closing line says Parts 19 to 22 are untouched; four of them are. Part  
8.6 was deleted without a search for its referrers.

Two more the forecast could not have seen because they are words and not  
operations: Part 11.2's *one internal base* reads as a shared type the port  
refuses to build, and Parts 12.2 and 12.5 say *list* for a surface R13 retyped to  
a queue. Both are the plan's third trap — a mechanism written as though it were  
the rule.

**And the finding a forecast cannot make at all: `Pool.put` strands items.**  
`pool.c3:426-428` unlocks for the hook, as Part 12.3 MUST requires, and relocks  
without re-reading the closed flag. A `Pool.close` in that window drains every  
bucket and runs the close hook; `put` then pushes into a closed and drained  
pool. The item is with nobody — the caller's Slot was emptied at `:422`, so Part  
9.4 tells the caller truthfully that the pool has it, and the close hook already  
ran. Invariant 34 and Part 11.8 both break on the one window. The mailbox has no  
equivalent: `send` holds the mutex from the closed test to the enqueue.

**Neither available repair is legal under 002**, and that is the finding's more  
important half. Returning the items to the caller is forbidden by Part 11.8; a  
second close hook is forbidden by Part 12.2's *called once*. So the audit splits  
it: **P1**, a 3tk defect, and **V11**, a rule that does not exist in the  
specification at all — *what the pool does with a hook's result when the pool  
closed while the hook ran*. dtk and otk will write this same code from the same  
silence. V11 is the one row of the eighteen whose replacement wording is not yet  
determined, and it is the reason 3TK-13 wants a ruling before it cuts.

Four smaller port-side findings: `NOT_AVAILABLE` escapes from every get mode on  
an unknown identity, against Part 19.3 MUST and observable in a fast build where  
the `@check` above it is nothing; a condition variable's own fault can escape a  
waiting call, dead code on posix and a contract statement in the port's two  
most-copied loops; the pool's leaver signals on one bucket over a condition  
variable shared by every identity, surviving on `broadcast` rather than on being  
correct — the mailbox got that same line right and 3TK-11's notes named it as the  
easiest one to half-fix; and Part 6.5 is a skipped SHOULD with no written why.

**The open question, and then the owner shrank it the same day.** The audit as  
first written said [3tk-who-supports-slot.md](3tk-who-supports-slot.md) touches  
Part 8.2 — *add at the back from a Slot* is listed there as a list operation —  
and was therefore an every-port question. The owner's answer: it is advice, and  
if 3tk's functionality needs the operation the port should not be made poorer  
for a recommendation; measure whether the current APIs use it.

**Measured, and it splits in two — P6.** Neither container in `3tk/src/` calls a  
Slot-shaped insert. §5.1's stated reason, *`send`, and the put hook's `extra`*,  
is half wrong: `Mailbox.send_at` empties the Slot itself and calls  
`push_back(Handle)`, `mailbox.c3:211` into `:150`, and `Pool.take_back` does the  
same into `push(Handle)` at `:448`/`:456`. But the `extra` half is right and the  
caller is the one that matters — a **hook**, application code, filling `extra`  
from a Slot it just created, `t_pool.c3:70`. That is Part 12.5's composite  
mechanism and it is a real requirement of the public surface. So  
`InnerQueue.push_back_slot` **stays**, Part 8.2 does not change for it, and the  
row leaves the every-port column.

What is left is `InnerStack.push_slot`: no caller in `src/`, one caller outside  
it — `t_stack.c3:133`, the test of the operation itself — and R13 puts  
`InnerStack` out of the application's reach entirely, so it has no caller it  
could ever acquire.

**Ruled and done the same day.** `InnerStack.push_slot` and `t_stack.c3`'s  
`push_from_a_slot` are deleted. **The stack has four operations**, and  
`stack.c3`'s header carries the reason where the next reader will meet it —  
including why the queue keeps its own, so nobody deletes that one by symmetry.  
Part 8.2 loses one operation of the eleven, not of the every-port count: this is  
3tk's own surface and 003 is not affected. It is the only code this line of work  
touched between 3TK-11 and 3TK-13.

*Advice on clear: clear between 3TK-12 and 3TK-13. The audit is the input; the  
walk that produced it is not.*

---

## 2026-08-24 — plan 007: an audit before the specification is cut

Written: `3tk-staging-plan-007.md`, adding **3TK-12**  
and **3TK-13**. Plan 006 to `backup/`, links corrected. `3tk-status.md` gains a  
section, *The gap between the port and the specification*. **No code touched.**

The owner asked for three things at once, and they turn out to be one thing:  
save what should be done later, confirm what the specification is *for*, and  
record where 3tk differs from it.

**Confirmed: the specification describes ztk.** 3TK-2 wrote  
`../common/backup/matryoshka-specification-002.md` from `../common/ztk-audit-001.md`  
and the three Zig sources; 68 of its lines are marked *ztk*. The document is  
port-neutral **where it states a promise** and Zig-shaped **where it states a  
mechanism** — the doubly-linked list, `prev`, the out-of-band anchor, one free  
list per identity. That is not a fault of 3TK-2; it is what 3TK-10 discovered,  
and R14 already rules it should be fixed.

**So its own claim is currently false for 3tk.** *A port is written from this  
file alone.* A port started from 002 today reproduces `prev`, the general list  
and the anchor, and then needs 3TK-10 and 3TK-11 run again against it. The gap  
opened when 3TK-11 ended and `../common/` was deliberately left untouched.

**Why an audit was added rather than cutting 003 directly.** R14 rules the  
move; it does not say what 003 says. The only list of changes on disk is  
proposal 002 §8.1 — nine Parts — and it is a **forecast written before the code  
existed**. 3TK-11 found three of 002's statements wrong: the stack has five  
operations and not six, tier 2 does not reach a fast build, and two `put_all`  
tests were converted rather than deleted. **None of the three is a decision;  
all three are the kind of detail a specification states as a rule.** A  
specification cut from a forecast carries the forecast's mistakes into dtk and  
otk, which read that file and nothing else and have no stage running to catch  
them.

**The audit's real deliverable is a split, not a list.** Every deviation is  
marked **3tk-only** or **every port**. Only the second kind may reach  
`../common/`. Getting that wrong in either direction is the expensive mistake:  
a 3tk-only row in 003 sends a C3 decision to D and Odin, and an every-port row  
left out of it leaves the same trap set that this whole line of work exists to  
clear. It is why 3TK-13 is declared and not authorized — the split has to be  
ruled before the cut is made.

**Two traps written into the plan in advance**, because they are the ones that  
make an audit worthless: copying §8.1 instead of measuring, and missing the  
Parts the redesign did not aim at. Parts 9, 12.5 and 17.2 were not aimed at and  
all three are touched by a container surface that changed shape. The stage walks  
all 22 Parts, and a missing Part is a failed stage rather than an omission.

**The status file carries the interim record.** Until 3TK-12 runs, *The gap  
between the port and the specification* is the only place the difference is  
written down, and it says of itself that it is a forecast and not an audit.  
After 3TK-12 runs, `3tk-deviations-001.md` is the record and that section points  
at it.

**`3tk-who-supports-slot.md` moved** from `3tk/src/` to the folder root, by the  
owner. It is listed in the status file's *Files* as owner input, open and ruled  
on by nothing, and it stays in *Open questions*.

**`3tk-porting-proposal-005.md` is recorded as a candidate**, on the owner's  
instruction, so it is planned later rather than remembered. It is a **revision**  
and not a stage: 004 is the design of record and it names `AnyNode`,  
`NodeList` and `Pool.put_all`, so a reader of 004 today is reading the port as  
it was before 3TK-11. **It waits on specification 003**, because nearly every  
decision in 004 justifies itself by citing a Part that 003 rewrites.

The note carries one warning, and it is the reason a table row was not enough:  
**do not renumber D1 to D16 and do not merge the D and R registers.** Every  
notes file, every negative program comment, `3tk-log.md` and `3tk-status.md`  
cite decisions by number. A renumber silently falsifies all of them, and with  
`git` off there is no revert. Two registers side by side, with 005 saying which  
R overtook which D — D14's anchor clause by R7, D12's blind spot by R6b, and  
nothing else.

---

## 2026-08-23 — 3TK-11: the core redesign, in code

Written: [3tk-core-redesign-notes-001.md](3tk-core-redesign-notes-001.md), and  
the port itself. `3tk-status.md` updated. `../common/` untouched, as plan 006  
required. No `git` command run.

**All four builds green — 59 checks, 0 failures. Both sanitizers clean. 85  
tests, up from 77.**

The stage had a specification and did not have a decision to make: R1 to R15,  
ruled question by question the same day. What follows is what the code taught,  
not what it chose.

**`AnyNode` → `Inner`, `AnyHandle` → `Handle`, `NodeList` → `InnerQueue` and a  
new `InnerStack`.** `any.c3` became `inner.c3`; `list.c3` became `queue.c3` and  
`stack.c3`; `t_list.c3` became `t_queue.c3` and `t_stack.c3`. The mechanical  
half was a single pass and the compiler caught every survivor, because none of  
these names is a string. **The real work was five files' worth of doc comments,  
every one of which argued for a shape that no longer exists.**

**The self-link has six sites, not four.** 002 §3.2 counted four — `pop`,  
`push`, `append_queue`, `iter` — and that count was for the queue alone. With  
the stack: `InnerQueue.push_back`, `InnerQueue.pop_front`,  
`InnerQueue.append_queue`, `InnerQueueIterator.next`, `InnerStack.push`,  
`InnerStack.pop`. All six are three lines or fewer, so 001's objection to  
mechanism B — three meanings across eleven sites — stays answered.

**Two of the six are where a translation of the old code goes wrong.**  
`pop_front` has to recognise the sole item by `head == tail`, because with the  
self-link there is no null `next` anywhere on a chain and the old `if (h.next)`  
would read a self-pointer as a real successor. And the walker has to end at  
`n.next == n`, or it yields the last item for ever. Every walk in `t_queue.c3`  
carries a count assertion for that reason: **a hang is a worse test failure than  
a wrong answer, because it reports nothing.**

**Invariant 5 was the one to get wrong, and 002 §4.4 said so in advance.** The  
leaver's signal in `receive`'s timeout path used to read `self._queue`, and the  
mechanical rewrite is `_regular` — which leaves a queued out-of-band item with  
nobody woken. It is written as a named predicate, `Mailbox.has_queued()`, over  
both queues. **No test catches this one**; a missed signal is a timing defect  
and the suite does not provoke it. What protects it is the name and the comment,  
and that is stated rather than papered over.

**Three corrections to 002, in details rather than in decisions.**

- **The stack has five operations, not six.** §5.1's own table lists exactly
  five — `push`, `push_slot`, `pop`, `is_empty`, `len` — and the sentence above  
  it says six. Twelve operations replace Part 8.2's sixteen; eleven of the  
  sixteen leave the port, not nine.
- **Tier 2 does not reach a fast build.** §10.3 says the rewritten negative
  "now aborts in a fast build too, because the check is tier 2". `@check` under  
  `--safe=no` expands to nothing at all — the whole of D6, and of 3TK-4's Q11  
  finding. What R6b bought is the exact check at O(1) in an ordinary safe build,  
  where before it cost an O(n) walk per insert. The abort was always there where  
  the checks are live.
- **Two `put_all` tests were converted rather than deleted.** §10.2 expected
  both gone. §6 had named the counter itself — *the caller now writes the loop,  
  with a chance of getting the refusal case wrong and losing items quietly* —  
  and deleting the only tests of the refusal path is the wrong answer to a risk  
  the proposal raised in writing. `t_pool.c3` grew `put_batch`, the seven-line  
  loop `Pool.put`'s doc comment now recommends, and both tests point at it. The  
  behaviour under test did not change; the code under test moved from the port  
  to the caller, so the test moved with it.

**The layering check had to be rewritten, not renamed.** `run-builds.sh`  
guarded Part 17.2 by grepping the containers for `unlink_no_repair|@guard_insert`.  
`unlink_no_repair` no longer exists — with no `remove` and no `pop_back` there  
is no unrepaired removal to reach for. **Grepping for a symbol that cannot  
appear is a check that passes for ever having proved nothing**, which is the  
exact failure `run-builds.sh` already records for `release_open_pool`. It now  
greps for `@guard_insert` and for any assignment to a `.next` field.

**Two tests were supposed to fail and did.** `t_identity.c3` and `t_owned.c3`  
both assert the inner's size against `2 * uptr::size + typeid::size`. They exist  
so a field cannot be added to the inner without someone deciding to, and they  
were the first thing the stage had to change — to `uptr::size + typeid::size`,  
16 bytes.

**Part 18 re-walked: still thirty-four rows.** Row 16 retired — *the link test  
is not a membership test*, which it now is — and the self-link invariant took  
its place. Row 22 **kept**, against plan 006's expectation that two queues would  
delete it: the anchor was the mechanism, the ordering is a promise. Row 13  
strengthened, because insert is O(1) in checking builds too. Rows 1 to 12, 18,  
19, 21 and 23 to 33 untouched, and section 6.2 — creation is a transaction — is  
the one a rewrite loses quietly and did not: both `create` functions keep every  
`defer catch` unchanged.

**One warning for the next port.** A blind rename of `Any` inside identifiers  
turned `remove_from_anywhere` into `remove_from_innerwhere`, in a test that was  
about to be deleted anyway. Rename on word boundaries, and read the diff.

**What this stage did not do, and the plan is why:** `../common/` is  
untouched, so **the port is now ahead of the specification it is written from**.  
A port written from `matryoshka-specification-002.md` today would reproduce  
`prev`, the general list and the anchor. R14 rules that 003 is cut; it is still  
not scheduled, and it is the strongest candidate for what runs next.  
`3tk-porting-proposal-004.md` is not edited either — §10.4 leaves it as the  
record of what was built.

**One open question this stage found and did not answer.**
[3tk-who-supports-slot.md](3tk-who-supports-slot.md), a note from the owner —
at `3tk/src/` while the stage ran, moved up to the folder root by the owner  
immediately after — argues the containers should not support the Slot idiom at  
all: that  
`push_back_slot` and `push_slot` belong on `Mailbox` and `Pool`. 3TK-10 did not  
rule on it and 3TK-11 did not act on it. It is in the status file's open  
questions now, because the note uses names the redesign refused and a reader who  
finds it cannot tell whether it is current.

## 2026-08-23 — the redesign is ruled, question by question, and proposal 002 is cut

Written: [3tk-core-redesign-proposal-002.md](3tk-core-redesign-proposal-002.md).  
001 to `backup/`, links corrected. `3tk-status.md` updated. **No code touched.**

The owner asked for the questions one at a time rather than as a list, and that  
is why three decisions moved. A list would have been accepted or refused whole.

**R6 refused — no membership field.** 001 wanted a third field, `void* chain`,  
at the same 24 bytes `prev` cost. The owner said: check what is possible with  
`next` alone. It is. **The last item of every chain points at itself**, so  
`is_linked` is `next != null` and it is **exact** — no blind spot, and it still  
deletes `contains` and the O(n) walk on every insert. `Inner` drops to two  
fields and 16 bytes.

**001's argument against the self-link was measured against the wrong  
container.** It said a terminator gives `next` three meanings across eleven  
sites in `list.c3`. Ruling 2 abolishes that container: with nine operations  
deleted, about four sites touch `next`. The field bought one query — *is it on  
__this__ container* — whose only caller, `remove`, is deleted.

**R11 has a reason now, and it is not performance.** 001 recorded the pool's  
reversal to last-in first-out as legal-but-arbitrary under Part 11.10. The  
owner's reason is **defect surfacing**: under first-in first-out, an item given  
back sits at the back of the free list, so code still keeping a pointer to it  
writes to an item nobody has re-taken and nothing conflicts — and if the put  
hook did not reset the contents, the stale writer sees data that still looks  
plausible. Under last-in first-out the **next `get` gives that item to a new  
owner**, so the two writers meet immediately and the defect appears next to its  
cause. Same reasoning as not quarantining freed memory. It goes in the doc  
comment on the pool's stack, because a later reader will otherwise take the  
stack for an arbitrary choice.

**R15 — `put_all` is dropped**, and it retires R4. The owner said it looked  
cumbersome and asked for a real opinion rather than a defence. It is: `Pool.put`  
in a loop, inherited from `pool.zig:394`, no batching and no atomicity. The  
claim that it encodes a fiddly loop once does not survive checking — **it does  
not spare the caller the difficult case, it gives the difficult case back in a  
different shape**, because a caller whose pool closed mid-batch still keeps a  
partly-emptied queue. Its price was a container operation nothing else needs, a  
MUST clause in Part 11.8 and the most awkward contract in the toolkit. Ruling  
2's own principle applies to it, and 001 had applied that principle to  
`NodeList` and not to this. **`InnerQueue` reaches seven operations and is  
genuinely minimal.**

**R8, R9, R12, R13, R14 accepted as proposed.** The give-back order is one  
sentence for both containers. Invariant 22 is kept and only the anchor goes.  
`Pool.close` empties every bucket into **one** `InnerQueue`, flattened — the  
hook never sees buckets — and **no order is promised**, because the hook's loop  
is the same either way. There is no `InnerList`. The specification moves to 003,  
which is ruled and not scheduled.

**A banned word, and a scan scope nobody had noticed.** The owner caught one of  
`rules-049.md` Part 5's banned words in 001. Part 5's own scan skips  
`design/secondary/`, so **no scan has ever covered this folder** — every  
document in it was written unchecked. A full scan against the whole list found  
nine hits, all in 001: three of that word, four custody-sense uses of two  
others, two AI-ish words. `3tk-status.md` and `3tk-log.md` were clean. 002 is  
clean against the whole list. 001 was left as it is, being a record.

Four builds green and sanitizers clean throughout — nothing in `3tk/` moved.

**3TK-11 has no open question in front of it.**

---

## 2026-08-23 — 3TK-10: the core redesign, as a proposal

Written: [3tk-core-redesign-proposal-001.md](backup/3tk-core-redesign-proposal-001.md),  
726 lines. **No code touched.** Four builds green, 59 checks, 0 failures, and  
the sanitizers clean — trivially, because nothing in `3tk/` moved.

The stage read the owner's two documents against `3tk/src/` rather than on  
trust, the way 3TK-8 read its review. That reading is the whole value of the  
stage and it disagreed with its inputs in three places.

**The required-operation audit passes.** Every one of `NodeList`'s sixteen  
operations was grepped for callers. `insert_before`, `remove`, `pop_back`,  
`front` and `back` **have no caller in `src/` at all** — only `t_list.c3` uses  
them. `insert_after` has exactly one, the out-of-band insert. `prev` has exactly  
one job, `unlink_no_repair`, which serves two dead operations. Nothing needs  
arbitrary removal, arbitrary insertion or backward traversal. Ruling 5 is safe.

**The out-of-band semantics are Meaning A**, absolute priority, FIFO within each  
class — `mailbox.c3:143-159`. `3tk-to-fifo-lifo-single-001.md` §4 refused to  
choose two queues before that was measured, and it was right to. Two queues  
reproduce it exactly. `t_mailbox.c3:139-162` does not change.

**The pool is FIFO today, not LIFO** — `pool.c3:263`, `:337`, `:425`. Ruling 3  
is therefore a **behaviour change**, not a container swap. It is legal: Part  
11.10 promises no order, and no test asserts the current one. Recorded rather  
than discovered later.

**Consequence 2 has a better answer than the four the plan listed.** With one  
link the last item of every queue has `next == null`, so the double-insert guard  
fails exactly where it matters. The plan named four mechanisms. The stage  
proposes a fifth reading of the same choice: **`prev` is deleted and a `void*  
chain` field takes its place.** The inner stays three words and 24 bytes, the  
check becomes exact — no blind spot, and membership is `chain == container` in  
O(1) — and **`contains` and the O(n) walk on every insert are deleted outright.**  
Part 8.7's own last bullet says a port that marks membership properly is  
strictly better and pays a field for it; ruling 5 is what makes the field free.  
So the redesign ends up **stronger** than what it replaces, which is not how  
consequence 2 was framed.

**Invariant 22 should not be deleted**, and the plan said it would be. The  
*anchor* dies. The *ordering* is a promise to callers, is asserted by a test,  
and is unchanged by two queues. Delete the mechanism clause of Part 11.3; keep  
the row.

**The close order:** out-of-band first, then ordinary, FIFO within each — for  
`close` and `receive_all` both, stated as one rule. It is the only order that  
changes nothing, because the single queue already produces it.

The cost: every source file changes, about 20 of 77 tests are rewritten and the  
rest renamed, and one negative — `insert_twice_same_list` — gains coverage  
rather than losing it, since its check moves from tier 3 to tier 2 and fires in  
a fast build too.

**Consequence 4: the recommendation is to move the specification to 003**, not  
to declare a 3tk deviation. Nothing in the redesign turns on a C3 capability, so  
it does not belong in a C3 document — and dtk has run no stage, so the cost  
lands where nothing is built. Nine Parts would move; §8.1 names each with its  
marking. `../common/` was not edited. The owner rules.

Fourteen decisions, R1 to R14. Seven are the stage's own. **R6, the `chain`  
field, is the one 3TK-11 cannot start without.**

3TK-11 stays declared and not authorized.

## 2026-08-23 — the core redesign is ruled, and 3TK-10 will design it

Written: `3tk-staging-plan-006.md`, adding **3TK-10**.  
Plan 005 to `backup/`, links corrected. `3tk-status.md` updated. **No code  
touched and no stage run** — this entry exists so the direction survives a  
context clear, because until now it lived only in a conversation.

Two documents arrived in the folder from the owner:
[3tk-naming-001.md](backup/3tk-naming-001.md), 476 lines, proposing Outer/Inner naming,
and [3tk-to-fifo-lifo-single-001.md](backup/3tk-to-fifo-lifo-single-001.md), 1058  
lines, arguing that `NodeList` should not be the centre of the design. The owner  
then gave the direction in five lines, and it is the input to 3TK-10 rather  
than a suggestion to be weighed:

1. Drop `Any*` and every inherited ztk name — **Outer / Inner**.
2. Stop reproducing Zig's `DoublyLinkedList`. No general-purpose list.
3. **FIFO for the mailbox, LIFO for the pool.**
4. **Two FIFOs in the mailbox**, ordinary and out-of-band.
5. **One link, not two.** `next` only.

This is the largest change since the port existed, and it is bigger than 3TK-8  
and 3TK-9 together. It deletes most of Part 8, retires `NodeList`, changes the  
inner that Part 4.2 fixes, and removes D14's anchor. So **3TK-10 ends at a  
proposal and does not touch `3tk/src/`** — the code is 3TK-11.

**The owner confirmed the sequence and asked for it on disk**, so plan 006  
carries both: 3TK-10 authorized, **3TK-11 declared and not authorized**, running  
only after the ruling on the proposal. Writing the second stage down now costs  
nothing and fixes the order against anyone's memory of the conversation. That is this folder's habit and there is no reason to break it for  
the one change most likely to need arguing about first.

Four consequences are written into the stage so a cold session does not have to  
find them:

- **Most of Part 8 goes.** `remove`, `insert_after`, `insert_before`, `pop_back`
  have no home in a FIFO or a LIFO, and several Part 18 invariants exist only to  
  guard them.
- **The double-insert guard weakens, and this is the sharp one.** `is_linked`
  asks `prev != null || next != null`. With one link, the last item in a queue  
  has `next == null` and is **indistinguishable from an item on no queue at  
  all** — so the check fails exactly where it matters. The stage must choose a  
  mechanism rather than discover the problem later.
- **Two FIFOs delete the anchor and invariant 22** — a real simplification — but
  raise a question the current design never had: what order `close` returns the  
  two queues in.
- **It is a specification change, not a port change.** Parts 4, 8 and 11 are in
  `../common/` and dtk and otk read them. The stage recommends; the owner rules.

The port as it stands is untouched and green — four builds, 59 checks, 77 tests,  
sanitizers clean. Nothing above is stale yet. It is about to be.

---


## 2026-08-23 — 3TK-9: the sanitizer found the tests, not the port

Written: [3tk-sanitizer-notes-001.md](3tk-sanitizer-notes-001.md),  
`3tk/run-sanitizers.sh`. Changed: `3tk/test/t_pool.c3`. Plan versioned to  
`005`; 004 moved to `backup/` with links corrected.  
Four builds green, 59 checks. Sanitizers clean, 3 runs, 0 findings.

The last item on the candidate list that could still find a defect in the port  
rather than in a document. Plan 003 asked for the concurrency tests "under  
whatever sanitizer the toolchain offers" and nobody had measured what that was.  
Three stages later, it found something on the first run.

**The tool was there and the machine was not.** c3c 0.8.3 has  
`--sanitize=address|memory|thread`. The first attempt failed at link — *cannot  
find /usr/lib64/libtsan.so.2.0.0* — and the temptation was to write that down as  
a c3c limitation. Two lines of C said otherwise: plain `cc -fsanitize=thread`  
fails identically, so Fedora simply does not have the runtimes installed. clang  
carries its own, and `c3c --cc clang` points the link at it. No install, no  
root, nothing changed on the machine. A stage that needs the owner to install  
packages is a stage that does not run on a fresh checkout.

**Then: `ThreadSanitizer: reported 4 warnings`.** All four in `TestHooks` —  
`gets++`, `puts++` and the two `last_*_count` writes — with three producers and  
three consumers on one pool. The frames that appear in `src/` are `pool.c3:284`  
and `:396`, the hook call sites, where the pool has **already unlocked**. The  
port put itself in the stack trace by obeying Part 12.3.

**The contract the tests broke is the port's own**, and it is written into  
`PoolHooks`'s doc comment as a contract rather than a warning: *hooks run  
outside the mutex, several at once, and a hook that touches shared state  
protects it itself.* `TestHooks` did not. It had been racing since 3TK-7 while  
every build reported green in four modes — because a data race is precisely the  
defect a passing test suite cannot see. The stage justified itself on its first  
run, and not in the way it expected: it did not find a bug in the toolkit, it  
found the toolkit's own tests failing to keep the toolkit's own rule.

**The wrong fix was one line and would have passed.** Hold the pool's mutex  
across the hook call and all four warnings vanish — along with Part 12.3, which  
exists to keep application code from running under a toolkit lock. A sanitizer  
says *there is a race*. It does not say *which side is wrong*, and that  
judgement is not the tool's. The counters became `Atomic{usz}`, the same  
mechanism the port uses for `_closed_fast`, in the hook where the specification  
puts the responsibility.

After the fix: zero warnings on `thread safe -O0`, zero on `thread fast -O3` —  
the mode where asserts are gone and the optimizer is most aggressive, and the  
one a race would most likely survive into — and AddressSanitizer clean.

**The harness stayed honest.** `run-sanitizers.sh` is a second script, not a row  
in `run-builds.sh`, because the gate requires `c3c` and nothing else and that  
property is worth more than the coverage. It skips loudly and **exits 2** when  
its compiler is absent — *a skip is not a pass* — and it separates *did not  
build* from *found something*, which is 3TK-8's harness lesson applied before it  
could cost anything twice.

**One fact nine stages had missed.** `c3c --help` carries `--test-noleak:  
Disable tracking allocator and memory leak detection for tests.` Leak detection  
has been **on by default** in every `c3c test` run this port has ever made, and  
no document said so. It takes nothing from 3TK-8's `t_alloc.c3` — that finds  
leaks on paths the tests cannot otherwise reach — but a port reading these notes  
should know the default exists before building its own.

*Advice on clear: clear.* The stage is closed and the notes carry everything.

---

## 2026-08-23 — 3TK-8: the review answered, and a leak nobody could reach

Written: [3tk-porting-proposal-004.md](3tk-porting-proposal-004.md), the design  
of record. `3tk/test/t_alloc.c3`, new. `3tk/src/mailbox.c3` and  
`3tk/src/pool.c3`, changed. Proposal 003, the 003 review and addendum 001 moved  
to `backup/`, links corrected in place. Four builds green, 59 checks, 0  
failures, 77 tests.

The input was `3tk-porting-proposal-003-review.md`: 28 items, about design and  
implementation rather than prose. It was read against `3tk/src/` before anything  
was accepted, and that audit changed most of the verdicts — five of its items  
were already true in the code, three of those in better shape than it assumed.

**D1's argument was wrong for three versions, and its ruling was right the whole  
time.** That is why nobody checked it. D1 said hiding the container internals  
must cost Part 11.1's MUST, having weighed two shapes; the review found a third  
that keeps `Pool` an item and hides only the operational state. The review put  
the confusion precisely: Part 11.1 requires *the container is itself an item*,  
and D1 assumed that implies *every byte of its state is inside the public  
struct*. It does not.

The owner ruled the same day, and the reason is better than the one it replaced:  
*"I don't like wars with language. If it does not support the feature + I need  
additional allocation — better not change code and add comment and update  
docs."* Nine measurements now stand behind it. **M5 is the one that decides the  
section** and it came from the owner asking the sharpest version of the  
question — restrict fields, not functions, via a `@private` fields-only struct  
inlined into the container. Six probes say C3 0.8.3 does not deliver it at any  
price: `@private` on a field is refused outright, on a struct it hides the type  
*name* only, and `inline` makes it worse by lifting the members into the outer's  
namespace. So no shape hides container state while leaving it inside the object.  
Hiding costs an allocation per container and buys a convention, not an  
enforcement. The port declines, on the record, on cost — **not** on Part 11.1.

**One real defect, and it is the kind that survives reviews.** Neither  
`Pool.create` nor `Mailbox.create` cleaned up after a partial failure. The pool  
allocated itself, a mutex, a condition variable, then the bucket array — and a  
failure at the last leaked all four. Both are transactions now, `defer catch`,  
in the shape `std::threads::channel` uses for the same problem.

Two stages and two reviews walked past it, and the reason is worth keeping: the  
leak lives in an error path no ordinary test takes, because on Linux `new_try`  
does not fail. The port had no way to make an allocator fail. So 3TK-8 built  
one, in `test/t_alloc.c3` — its own file, on the owner's instruction, because  
`common.c3` is the shared fixture every other test compiles against.

**The test was checked by sabotage, not by passing.** Removing the pool's  
`defer catch` lines turns the suite red. Removing the mailbox's leaves it green  
— its only acquisition through the caller's allocator is the object itself, so  
that path cannot be provoked at all. Both facts are written at the test site.  
A test whose failure is impossible is worse than no test, and the honest thing  
is to say which is which rather than count four tests and call the fix covered.

**Section 6 is the durable half of this stage.** Six implementation invariants  
the port already honoured and no document stated: the pre-lock atomic as a hint  
that may reject but never authorize; creation as a transaction; `close` is not  
`destroy`; the hook unlock/relock contract and the staleness of everything read  
before it; no reference into bucket storage across a hook, with `Pool.get_wait`  
named as the one safe exception and why; and the lock order as a statement about  
today rather than a timeless property. Plus the `AnyHandle`/`Slot` signature  
rule, audited against every public signature, with no violation found — and M4  
under it, because a method cannot attach to a pointer alias, so C3 will only let  
one of the two be an object.

Deferred with the reason written down rather than dropped: the `NodeList`  
mutation core. Removal is already centralized in `unlink_no_repair`; the four  
insert sites are different shapes and collapsing them buys less than it costs  
while every test is green. Rejected: the opaque `char[N]` storage, for the  
reasons the review itself gives against it.

Four text corrections closed the drift the review found: the Part 4.2 mapping  
row and D12 still said "a third field" when the inner has three, the 24 bytes  
read as an invariant in one row when it is an observation, and Part 15.2's lock  
statement was timeless where it should be current.

**No decision moved.** Sixteen decisions, four versions, and D1 reaffirmed after  
its argument was found defective — which is the distinction this folder keeps: a  
ruling and the reason for it are not the same thing, and only one of them was  
wrong.

*Advice on clear: clear.* The stage is closed, the documents carry everything,  
and nothing in context is needed by the candidates for a 3TK-9.

---


## 2026-08-23 — 3TK-8's four questions, all ruled before the stage started

The owner answered every open question in the stage, one at a time, so 3TK-8  
begins with nothing outstanding. The rulings, and what each changed:

**D1 stands, and the reason is replaced.** Public direct representation, and no  
code changes for the sake of hiding. The owner's reason is better than the one  
the document currently carries — *no wars with the language.* C3 0.8.3 enforces  
no field privacy at any price (addendum 001, M5), so the port declines to buy an  
allocation and a lifetime rule per container for a boundary the language will  
not keep. A comment marks it instead. The `Impl*` split is rejected on cost, on  
the record, and **not** on Part 11.1 — which is the correction `003-review`  
asked for, reached from the other direction.

**The capability answers live in proposal 004 only.** `c3-capabilities-001.md`  
is the 3TK-4 output and is not amended; no 002 is cut. One home for the  
measurements, beside the decision they support.

**The failing-allocator test gets built, in a file of its own.** The owner's  
advice, and it is better than the plan's first draft: `3tk/test/t_alloc.c3`  
rather than an addition to `common.c3`. `common.c3` is the shared fixture every  
test file compiles against, and an allocator that fails on purpose does not  
belong in it. The allocators also outlive this stage — counting, failing, an  
arena later — and a file named for the subject is where the second one goes  
without a discussion. Verified while writing it down: `project.json` declares  
`"test-sources": [ "test" ]`, so the harness needs no edit at all.

**The 003 review moves to `backup/`** once 004 answers it, as the first review  
did — and only after 004 carries what a current reader needs from it. Until  
then it is input and stays live.

Two of the four rulings changed the plan rather than confirming it: the  
dedicated test file, and D1's replacement reasoning. Both are in  
`3tk-staging-plan-004.md`, and the questions are kept with their answers because  
the reasons are part of the design record.

Still no code touched. `3tk/run-builds.sh` last reported four builds green, 59  
checks, 0 failures.

## 2026-08-23 — D1 ruled again, and the reason replaced

The owner closed the review's central question. D1's **ruling** stands — public  
direct representation, `Mailbox` and `Pool` as public structs with their state  
stored directly in them — and **no code changes for the sake of hiding.**

The owner's words, because the reason is better than the one D1 currently  
gives: *"I don't like wars with language. If it does not support the feature and  
I need an additional allocation — better not change code, add a comment and  
update the docs."*

That is the whole argument, and it is stronger than what it replaces. 003 says  
Part 11.11 is skipped because the only mechanism that delivers it costs Part  
11.1's MUST. That was never true, and both `003-review` and addendum 001 M5 show  
why. What is true is narrower and harder: **C3 0.8.3 enforces no field privacy  
at any price.** Not through `@private` on a struct, which hides the type name  
and leaves every field reachable. Not through `inline`, which lifts the fields  
into the outer's namespace and makes it worse. Not through `@private` on a  
field, which the compiler refuses outright. The shapes that *would* hide the  
state — the `Impl*` pointer, the opaque `char[N]` — all work by moving it out  
of the object, and they cost an allocation and a lifetime rule per container.

So the port pays nothing for a boundary the language will not keep, and marks  
it with a comment instead. Reachable fields plus a documented convention, with  
the price visible. The `Impl*` split is rejected **on the record and on cost**,  
not on Part 11.1 — which is exactly the correction the review asked for, now  
arrived at from the other direction.

3TK-8 carries it: D1's argument rewritten, the field-role comments written, the  
documents updated, and no signature moved. One of the stage's four open  
questions is closed; three remain and none blocks it.

## 2026-08-23 — how C3 binds methods, and what it will not hide

Written: [3tk-porting-proposal-addendum-001.md](backup/3tk-porting-proposal-addendum-001.md).  
Not a stage and not a revision — an addendum. It moves no decision, changes no  
code, and 3TK-8 folds it into proposal 004.

The owner asked whether C3 supports calling `functionCall(handle, ...)` as  
`handle.functionCall(...)`. Four probes against `c3c` 0.8.3 answered it, and  
the answer was worth keeping.

**No.** C3 has no UFCS: a free function called with dot syntax is a hard error.  
What it has is method functions, `fn void Type.f(&self)`, where the receiver is  
written into the declaration. Every dotted call in `3tk/src/` is one of those.  
D is the language that does the rewrite, which is where the question came from.

Two things fell out that the folder had never written down. A method may be  
declared on a type from **another** module — so no argument about the split  
representation may claim it would force methods into one module. And methods  
attach to named types and **never to a pointer alias**: `alias AnyHandle =  
AnyNode*` can carry no methods, while `typedef Slot` can. The asymmetry between  
handle and Slot in every signature in the port is therefore **partly forced by  
the language**, not purely a design choice — which gives D5 a second leg and is  
the fact the review's §14 signature rule should be stated with.

The probes also reproduced F2 of the toolkit notes from the compiler's own  
mouth: *"'@public' modifiers are ignored for method declarations."*

**M5 came from a second question the same day, and it is the one that matters  
to D1.** The owner wanted field access restricted without restricting  
functions: a `@private` fields-only struct, `inline` inside the public  
container, transparent to `mtk`'s own methods and closed to an application. Six  
probes say C3 0.8.3 does not deliver it. `@private` on a struct is a  
**type-name** rule — another module cannot *name* `MailboxInternals`, which is  
real — but every field inside it stays readable, writable and addressable  
through the outer, and the write lands. `@private` on a field is refused  
outright: *"'@private' cannot be used here."* There is no field-level privacy in  
the language.

`inline` makes it worse rather than better. It lifts the hidden fields into the  
outer's namespace, so `mb.closed` needs no `.guts` at all. And `inline` must be  
the **first** field, which puts it in competition with `AnyNode node` for  
position — survivable, since D2 already lets the inner sit anywhere, and the  
only part of the idea that was.

The consequence is that the review's central dichotomy is now standing on  
measurement instead of inference. **No shape hides container state while  
leaving it inside the object.** Hiding costs an indirection — and it does not  
cost Part 11.1. That is exactly what `003-review` argued, and D1's rewrite in  
proposal 004 can now say it with the probes behind it.

Nothing was touched but documents. `3tk/run-builds.sh` last reported four  
builds green, 59 checks, 0 failures.

## 2026-08-23 — a second review, and the plan versioned to 004 for it

Written: `3tk-staging-plan-004.md`, adding **3TK-8**.  
Plan 003 moved to `backup/` and every link naming it corrected in place.  
`3tk-status.md` updated. Nothing of 3TK-8 has run — no measurement, no  
document, no code.

The input is `3tk-porting-proposal-003-review.md`, which arrived in the folder  
untracked. It reads proposal 003 for **design and implementation** and says so  
in its own scope section: *not advice about improving the document structure or  
prose*. That is a different instrument from the first review, and it earned a  
different answer.

**Why a stage and not a revision.** Proposal 003 came out of a revision — the  
owner accepted the decisions, the review was answered, no plan version was cut.  
This one touches `3tk/src/`, adds tests, and needs a measured answer from `c3c`  
before its central paragraph can be written. Measurement plus code is  
stage-shaped, and the alternative is an unrecorded revision that quietly  
rewrites the port. So it got a row, and the plan got a version.

**The audit came before the plan.** The previous review was written against the  
proposal text and had never opened `3tk/src/`, which is why most of its findings  
were text drift. This one makes claims about the code, so every claim was  
checked against the code before the stage's scope was fixed. What that changed:

*The headline is real.* D1 weighs two shapes — public fields, or  
`typedef Pool = void` — and concludes that hiding must cost Part 11.1's MUST. A  
third shape exists: `struct Pool { AnyNode node; PoolImpl* impl; }`. `Pool` is  
still the type the application names, still embeds `AnyNode`, still crosses  
through `mtk::helper{Pool}`, still sits on a `NodeList`. The review separates  
two requirements D1 collapses — *the container is itself an item*, which Part  
11.1 requires, and *every byte of its state is in the public struct*, which D1  
assumes follows. It does not follow. The ruling stays; the argument goes.

*Five items were already satisfied, and one better than the review assumed.*  
The pre-lock atomic is already a hint with a mandatory re-read. `close` is  
already not `destroy`. And §19 asks that no `PoolBucket*` be carried across a  
hook call — `Pool.put` already re-looks-up by identity in `take_back_handle`  
rather than holding `b` across the unlock. Those become documented invariants,  
which is the cheapest and most durable part of the whole review: the code  
honours them and no document states them, so a later improvement could undo  
them in silence.

*One real defect, and the review could not see it.* §20 asks for `Pool.create`  
to be transactional, reasoning about a design it thought might exist. Read  
against the code, the defect is real and broader than its framing: **neither  
creation path cleans up after a partial failure.** `Pool.create` (`pool.c3:158`)  
allocates the `Pool`, then a failure in `_mu.init()!`, `_cv.init()!` or  
`new_array_try(...)!` propagates out and leaks it, plus whatever was already  
initialized. `Mailbox.create` (`mailbox.c3:78`) is the same shape. The  
duplicate-identity check 003 added runs before any allocation, so that part was  
already transactional — the allocation sequence never was. Two reviews and two  
stages walked past it.

*Four drifts are text-only, and narrower than stated.* Section 1 of 003 already  
states the two-parts/three-fields distinction correctly; only the Part 4.2  
mapping row and D12 kept the old wording. Nothing in `3tk/src/` asserts  
`sizeof(AnyNode) == 24` — checked, not assumed.

*One thing is deferred rather than rejected.* §15 wants a private mutation core  
under `NodeList`. Removal is already centralized in `unlink_no_repair`; the four  
insert sites are genuinely different shapes, and collapsing them buys less than  
it costs while every test is green. Written down so a later stage can take it,  
rather than dropped.

3TK-8's plan section carries the whole audit as a table — what the review  
claimed, and what the code said back — so the stage starts from evidence rather  
than from assertions. Four questions for the owner are in it, and none of them  
blocks it from starting.

`3tk/run-builds.sh` still reports four builds green, 59 checks, 0 failures. No  
code has been touched yet.

## 2026-08-23 — the specification left this folder

Moved: `matryoshka-specification-002.md` and `ztk-audit-001.md` to
[`../common/`](../common/README.md), and specification 001 to
`../common/backup/`. Created `../common/README.md` and
[`../common/port-flow-001.md`](../common/port-flow-001.md). Not a stage, and not
a revision either — nothing was rewritten. A reorganization.

The reason is the review answered earlier the same day. Twenty-seven items were  
raised against the C3 proposal and **two of them were specification defects**.  
The specification describes itself as language-neutral and self-contained — *a  
port is written from this file alone* — yet it lived inside `c3/`, one  
consumer's folder. Had those two been fixed only in the C3 document, the same  
trap would have stayed set for dtk and otk. A shared input that lives in a  
consumer's folder is a fork waiting to happen, so it now lives where it belongs  
and every port links to it.

The ztk audit went with it for the same reason: it is read-only evidence about  
**Zig**, the reference implementation, and there is nothing C3 in it.

`port-flow-001.md` is new, and it is the 3tk process with C3 removed. Three  
tiers, because the failure mode of reusing a proven flow is inheriting the  
previous language's answers along with its questions. Tier 1 transfers as  
written — cold-start stages, *finishing a stage does not start the next*, the  
provenance rule, the three shapes of negative test, **compile judged separately  
from run**, and sabotage verification. The compile-versus-run rule carries the  
`release_open_pool` story as its reason, because a rule with a corpse attached  
is obeyed. Tier 2 transfers only as a question, and the sharpest entry is the  
build matrix: **not four builds** — four is this port's `--safe` × `-O` axis, and  
a port that copies the number has performed a ritual rather than a verification.

Fourteen links across nine files were rewritten, in both directions, by  
resolving each link's basename against where the file actually lives. Zero  
dangling links after. The two `.c3` headers naming `matryoshka-specification-001.md`  
were left exactly as they are — they mention the file, they do not link to it,  
and they are provenance. A path is not a pointer.

`3tk/run-builds.sh` still reports four builds green, 59 checks, 0 failures. The  
move touched no code.

## 2026-08-23 — the review answered, and a test that never ran

Written: `matryoshka-specification-002.md`, `3tk-porting-proposal-003.md`.  
Both predecessors stay on disk. Not a stage — a revision, so no plan version.

The input was `3tk-porting-proposal-review.md`: 27 items against proposal 002,  
careful and mostly right. It had been written against the proposal text alone  
and had never opened `3tk/src/`, so every item was re-audited against the  
specification, the ztk reference, the C3 source and the tests before anything  
was changed. That changed several verdicts.

**Two items were not proposal defects at all.** Part 4.2 says the inner has  
"exactly two parts" and then warns against "a third field", when `prev`, `next`  
and `type` are already three — the proposal had faithfully inherited the  
specification's own imprecision. And the review asked which wins when a mailbox  
is closed but still holds items, a question the specification leaves open and  
its outcome tables invite. It cannot happen: `close` drains the queue in one  
step under the mutex and a send after the flag is refused under that same  
mutex. ztk agrees. Both went into the specification instead, where the other  
three ports will find them, and the second became **invariant 34** — a closed  
container is empty.

**One item was rejected.** The review suggested `wake_all` need not report  
`CLOSED`. Part 19.1 fixes that outcome set, and the port is right; only the  
reason was missing.

**One became code.** `Pool.create` accepted a duplicate identity, and  
`bucket_for` returns the first match, so a second bucket for the same identity  
would never be found — a pool quietly holding half of what its creator asked  
for. It now refuses, tier 2, with a negative program. The owner ruled on this  
one directly.

**And building that found something the review could not have seen.**  
`negative/release_open_pool.c3` had never compiled. It spelled a type's  
identity `Msg.typeid`, which c3c 0.8.3 rejects, and the harness ran  
`compile-run` and read any non-zero exit as the abort it was looking for — a  
compile failure is a non-zero exit. So the pool half of Part 11.12, *the one  
precondition the specification refuses to soften*, the only site that aborts in  
all four builds, had been resting on a program that never ran, reported green  
the whole time.

The spelling is fixed and the harness now compiles and runs as separately  
judged steps, failing loudly on a negative that will not build. The new  
duplicate-tag check was sabotaged before being trusted, and the suite went red  
in both checking builds as it should.

Four builds green: 59 checks, 73 tests. Part 18 is thirty-four invariants now,  
twenty-nine of them tested.

The lesson is D7's, from the other side. D7 was proved by sabotaging a correct  
implementation and watching the suite catch it. This was the same lesson unpaid:  
a test nobody had ever seen fail, passing for a reason nobody had checked.

---

## 2026-08-23 — the owner's ruling, and the port closes

Written: `3tk-porting-proposal-002.md`. `3tk-porting-proposal-001.md` stays on  
disk, superseded.

**The owner accepted all sixteen decisions, and accepted G1's submodules.**  
Not a stage — a ruling, which is why it produced no plan version.

The decisions had been marked *PROPOSED — owner overridable* since 3TK-5, which  
ran without the ruling it was waiting for. 3TK-6 and 3TK-7 then built them, and  
all sixteen survived contact with the compiler. That was the evidence the ruling  
had been waiting for, and it is the reason the ruling is one line rather than a  
review of sixteen arguments.

Version 002 says *ruling* where 001 said *proposal*. The arguments are unchanged  
— each decision still carries the alternative it rejects, because the reason a  
thing was chosen outlives the choosing.

Nine amendments folded in, each marked with the finding that produced it, and  
**none of them moves a decision**:

- **G1**, the one the owner ruled on separately: the containers are
  `module mtk::mailbox` and `module mtk::pool`, not `module mtk`. Section 1  
  now carries the module names beside the file names and says why — a C3  
  submodule cannot see its parent's `@private` declarations, so Part 17.2's  
  layering is enforced by the compiler rather than promised.
- **F1**, the worst thing 001 got wrong: the safe optimized build is
  `--safe=yes -O3`, not `-O3`. Section 7.2 now says so and says never to infer  
  the mode from the `-O` level.
- F3 and F5 on `@check`: not `@private`, and the message is compile-time.
- F4: one alias per declaration; there is no whole-module form.
- G2: `return mtk::CLOSED~;`, because `?` marks the optional type.
- G4: a flat `PoolBucket[]` instead of a `HashMap`.
- G5: `put` involves two Slots, and section 5.9 now says which is which.
- Section 9 became a record of what was built instead of a plan for what might
  be.

The conflict register's seven closures are marked accepted with it.

**The 3tk line of work is complete.** The port covers all of Part 22, all  
thirty-three invariants of Part 18 are reached, and `3tk/run-builds.sh` is green  
in four builds. What remains is outside the specification: a sanitizer run, a  
cross-target build, and packaging.

Advice: **clear.** Nothing is pending.

---

## 2026-08-23 — 3TK-7, the two containers in C3

Written: `3tk/src/mailbox.c3`, `3tk/src/pool.c3`, three more test files, four  
more negative programs, and `3tk-containers-notes-001.md`, 299 lines.

The plan was versioned to `3tk-staging-plan-003.md` first. Its only change is  
the addition of 3TK-7.

Steps 6 and 7 of Part 22. **The port is now complete against the  
specification** — Part 17.1's required tool and both of Part 17.2's optional  
ones.

The owner was offered the mailbox/pool split when 3TK-7 was scoped and did not  
take it, so both containers were done in one stage. The mailbox was finished  
and green before the pool was started, so the seam stayed available throughout.

**Result: all four builds green, 55 checks, 0 failures.** 71 tests run four  
times, 6 runtime negatives, 2 tier 1 negatives, 3 compile-time refusals, and 3  
layering checks. 37 tests at the end of 3TK-6, 71 now.

The three things plan 003 named in advance all landed.

**D7's wait loop, and a test that can tell.** The trouble with Part 2.5 is that  
a wrong implementation passes every ordinary timeout test.  
`the_deadline_is_anchored_once` has a second thread broadcast every 20ms for a  
second while a waiter asks for 200ms. Anchored, it returns at ~200ms; on  
`wait_timeout` every broadcast restarts the timeout. **The test was verified by  
sabotage** — `wait_until(deadline)` was swapped for `wait_timeout(timeout)` and  
the suite reported `FAILED: 70 passed, 1 failed` with the intended message. The  
sabotage was reverted. A test for an invariant of this shape is worth nothing  
until it has been seen to fail.

**D6 tier 1 has its first two sites.** `Mailbox.release` and `Pool.release` use  
`always_assert` and abort in every build mode, `--safe=no -O3` included.  
`run-builds.sh` grew a third negative shape for them: every other negative  
asserts opposite behaviours across builds, and a tier 1 negative asserts the  
same behaviour in all four. Both programs print `SOFTENED:` if they ever reach  
their last line and the script fails on that string.

**Part 12.3.** `hooks_run_outside_the_mutex` has the hook count its own  
concurrent entries and hold itself open. Four threads, and if the pool held its  
lock the maximum would be one.

Six findings. The first is a structural change and needs the owner:

- **G1. The containers belong in submodules, and C3 makes Part 17.2 free.** The
  proposal put `Mailbox` and `Pool` in `module mtk`, which makes the layering a  
  promise checkable only by review. F3 of the toolkit notes — `@private` does  
  not reach a submodule — was recorded there as an irritation and is the  
  solution here. `module mtk::mailbox` and `module mtk::pool` are structurally  
  outside `mtk`, so **Part 17.2 is enforced by the compiler**. The move was not  
  free and the compiler said so at once, with six errors demanding  
  `mtk::CLOSED` instead of `CLOSED` — which is the enforcement working. The API  
  reads better too: `mailbox::create(a)`, `pool::of(h)`. **Recommended as an  
  amendment to the proposal's section 1; the owner's to accept.**
- **G2.** The fault-return operator is `~`, not `?`. `return CLOSED~;`. D15
  chose faults and did not spell the return.
- **G3. Part 11.2's shared base cannot be a shared struct.** Part 4.4 allows one
  inner per outer, so a base carrying the inner and embedded in both containers  
  gives each an inner one level down. The five members are repeated instead,  
  which 11.2's own text permits. Recorded because a reader who takes 11.2 as a  
  factoring instruction will build the bug.
- **G4.** A flat `PoolBucket[]` beats the proposal's `HashMap` for a set that is
  fixed at creation and small.
- **G5. `put` involves two Slots, and the proposal did not say so.** The pool
  takes the item from the caller's Slot before the hook sees anything, and  
  hands the hook a Slot of its own. Passing the caller's through would make a  
  hook that keeps the item read as *refused*.
- G6: small spellings again.

**Sixteen decisions, sixteen exercised, sixteen survived.** Across both code  
stages the amendments are two spellings and one structural recommendation, and  
none in substance.

**Part 18 is complete.** All thirty-three invariants reached: twenty-eight  
tested or provoked, five structural or documented, and each says which.

What is not done, listed honestly in the notes: no sanitizer run — plan 003  
asked for one and it was not done, nor was it measured whether c3c 0.8.3 offers  
one; the signal hand-off test is a race run 20 times, which is evidence rather  
than proof; and linux-x64 is the only target built, where ztk is green on three.

Advice: **clear.** The port is complete and the documents carry it. What is  
waiting is the owner's ruling on the sixteen decisions — which now have the  
evidence they were waiting for, since all sixteen have survived a compiler — and  
G1 as an amendment.

## 2026-08-23 — 3TK-6, the toolkit in C3

Written: `3tk/` — 5 source files, 5 test files, 9 negative programs, a  
`project.json` and `run-builds.sh` — and `3tk-toolkit-notes-001.md`, 322 lines.

The plan was versioned to `3tk-staging-plan-002.md` first. Its only change is  
the addition of 3TK-6; stages 3TK-0 to 3TK-5 are reproduced unaltered. The  
provenance lines in the 3TK-1 to 3TK-5 outputs still name plan 001, because  
that is the version they ran under; the live pointers in `3tk-status.md` were  
repointed.

**The first stage that writes C3.** Steps 2 to 5 of Part 22: the inner and the  
identity, the per-type helper with the crossings, the Slot and its six rules,  
the list with both insert checks. Part 17.1's one required tool. The two  
containers are not here.

The owner named the stage and told it to run in the same breath, without ruling  
separately on the sixteen decisions. That was read as acceptance of  
`3tk-porting-proposal-001.md` as written, and the plan section says so.

**Result: all four builds green, 44 checks, 0 failures.** 37 tests run four  
times, 6 runtime negative programs, 3 compile-time refusals. `run-builds.sh` is  
the verification and exits non-zero on any failure.

The negatives are the part that carries weight. Each provokes one contract  
violation and asserts **both** halves: it must abort in a checking build, and  
it must run to the end and exit 0 in a fast one. A negative that aborted in a  
fast build would mean a plain `assert` had survived somewhere.

Nine findings. The first is the one that matters:

- **F1. `-O2` and above turn safe mode off, silently.** The proposal's section
  7.2 spelled the "safe, optimized" build `-O3`. Measured: `-O3` reports  
  `SAFE_MODE=false`. So that build was the fast build under another name, and a  
  suite run under it tested nothing new. The first run of `run-builds.sh`  
  caught it exactly as designed — five negatives reported *did NOT abort in a  
  checking build*. The script was right and the proposal was wrong. Every build  
  in the port is now explicit on both sides, `--safe=yes` or `--safe=no`, and  
  the mode is never inferred from the `-O` level. 3TK-4's Q11 measured the  
  default and `--safe=no -O3`; neither exposes the implicit switch. The study is  
  short by one row, not wrong.
- **F2. `@private` is ignored on method declarations, entirely.** C3 0.8.3 can
  hide neither a field (Q4) nor a method. This lands on D1 and strengthens it:  
  D1 chose the border over the opaque type, and the alternative it did not  
  consider turns out not to exist either. `NodeList.contains` and  
  `NodeList.unlink_no_repair` are public whether the port likes it or not, and  
  the second is named for what it leaves undone.
- **F3. `@private` does not reach a submodule**, so `@check` cannot be private
  as D6's sample wrote it. The resolution is Part 17.2 rather than a  
  workaround: an application writing its own Slot-shaped call is entitled to  
  the same contract check, so `@check` is public on purpose.
- **F4. A generic module instantiates per declaration, not as a whole.** The
  proposal's section 1 showed `alias msg = mtk::helper{Msg};`. There is no such  
  form — nine aliases, or inline instantiation. 3TK-4's Q1 said this and the  
  proposal contradicted it.
- F5 to F9: `always_assert` takes a compile-time message; a module-scope
  `$assert` cannot see a generic module's type parameter; `alloc::new` aborts  
  and `alloc::new_try` is what Part 9.2 rule 4 needs; eight small spellings the  
  proposal guessed at; and there is no front door to write, because in C3 the  
  module is the front door.

**The sixteen decisions: nine exercised, nine survived.** Nothing the code met  
contradicted a decision. D3 and D6 were amended in spelling only, by F6/F7 and  
F5. Seven are untouched because they belong to the containers — D7, D9, D13,  
D14, D16 — or are barely reachable here, D15.

Part 18: the toolkit reaches twenty invariants and fifteen are tested or  
provoked; rows 6 and 14 are structural and say so.

One thing worth keeping. D12 accepted the link test's blind spot, and an  
accepted cost that is only documented gets "fixed" by the next reader.  
`the_link_test_has_a_blind_spot` asserts that an item alone on a list reports  
false, so closing the blind spot fails a test that names D12. Its mirror,  
`the_walk_has_a_blind_spot_too`, states the other half of Part 8.6's argument.

Three places where the specification is silent and the code had to choose are  
recorded in the notes as findings rather than taken quietly: inserting from an  
empty Slot, removing an item that is not on this list, and null as the answer  
from an empty list.

The stage created the tree at the repository root by mistake and moved it under  
`c3/3tk/` before anything was committed. The storage rule holds.

Advice: **clear.** The container stage, if the owner names it, reads the  
proposal, the specification and `3tk-toolkit-notes-001.md`. The notes carry  
what the code taught; the code carries the rest. What must not be lost is F1,  
and it is written in three places — the notes, this entry, and a comment block  
in `run-builds.sh` itself.

## 2026-08-23 — 3TK-5, the 3tk porting proposal

Written: `3tk-porting-proposal-001.md`. 984 lines.

Inputs: `matryoshka-specification-001.md`, `3tk-drafts-review-001.md`,  
`c3-capabilities-001.md`, and this folder's status file. The seven drafts were  
not reopened. `src/` was not reopened. No C3 was compiled in this stage — 3TK-4  
did the compiling, and this stage reads its results.

**The stage ran without the two owner rulings it was waiting on.** `3tk-status.md`  
recorded 3TK-5 as blocked on the C1-to-C11 ruling and on Q4. Neither had been  
given. A porting proposal is the document where such rulings are *proposed*, so  
every open decision is decided in it, argued, and marked **PROPOSED — owner  
overridable**. Nothing in the file is settled until the owner says so.

Sixteen decisions, D1 to D16. They absorb the eight items the capability study  
carried forward, the eleven of the conflict register, and the ten of Part 20.

The four that carry weight:

- **D1, Q4.** Public struct, public fields, the helper border does the work.
  Part 11.11 SHOULD is skipped with the reason written down: the only C3  
  mechanism that delivers it — `typedef Pool = void` — costs Part 11.1 MUST,  
  the containers being themselves items. A SHOULD is not traded for a MUST.
- **D3, the allocators.** Answered per type rather than once for the port. The
  inner does not grow a third field (Part 4.2, every item pays). An item that  
  wants a release with no allocator parameter keeps the allocator in its own  
  *outer* and takes `mtk::owned <Type>`, whose build-time `$assert` finds the  
  field and, when it is missing, names the other helper in the message. C7 and  
  the status file's first open question are answered together, as the review  
  required.
- **D6, the assert policy.** Q11's trap — a plain `assert` under `--safe=no -O3`
  is an assumption the optimizer may act on, not a removed check — is routed  
  around rather than documented. One port macro, `mtk::@check`, expands to  
  `always_assert` in a safe build and to *nothing* otherwise. Three tiers:  
  `always_assert` for Part 11.12 alone, `@check` for every other contract  
  violation, a `$if COMPILER_SAFE_MODE` block for Part 8.6's O(n) walk. No  
  plain `assert` guards a contract anywhere in the port.
- **D5 with D4.** The Slot is a distinct `typedef`; the handle is a transparent
  alias and there is only one of it. The cast cost that sinks typed handles  
  (C10) does not arise for the Slot, because every function that takes one takes  
  `Slot*` by design. The two-star confusion four drafts fell into no longer  
  typechecks.

Also decided: no `inline` on the inner field (D2, for Part 7.5 and Part 10.1);  
interruption dropped (D9, as Part 2.9's own text permits); two composing generic  
modules instead of ztk's branching generator (D10); Part 22's order kept (D11);  
`NodeList`, not `AnyList`, because `std::collections::anylist` exists and  
copies (D8); faults as the outcome mechanism (D15); the pre-lock fast path kept  
with its mandatory re-check (D16).

The mapping covers every MUST and SHOULD of Parts 1 to 17, part by part, with  
the full sixteen-operation list surface (C6), the three hook signatures as the  
specification requires them, and both container surfaces with their outcome  
sets. `put` and `put_all` return `void`, not `void?` — Part 9.4, the Slot is the  
answer.

Six things are dropped: two SHOULDs with written reasons, three MAYs whose  
conditions are not met, and the `interrupted` outcome as a consequence of D9.

Build and test: one `project.json`, closing C9 with a third shape rather than  
choosing between two that were never compiled, and **four builds, every time**.  
The fourth — `--safe=no -O3` — is the one that segfaulted in Q11's probe, and  
running it is what proves D6 was applied. The layering claim of Part 17.2 is  
made a test: `mailbox.c3` and `pool.c3` reference no `@private` name of the core  
four.

All eleven conflicts are now closed — four by 3TK-4, seven here, every one of  
the seven overridable.

`kitchen/tools/check_design.sh` still exits 1, unchanged in cause. This file adds  
one orphan row for the same `context.md` drift 3TK-2 hit. Not a regression, and  
not fixed here.

Advice: **clear.** 3TK-6, if the owner names it, writes C3 from the proposal and  
the specification. Nothing in this stage's reasoning is needed once the file is  
on disk — the file *is* the reasoning. What must not be lost is the state of the  
sixteen decisions, and that lives in `3tk-status.md`.

## 2026-08-23 — 3TK-4, the C3 capability study

Written: `c3-capabilities-001.md`. 740 lines.

Inputs: the C3 stdlib at `/home/g41797/dev/langs/c3/lib/std/`, Part 21 of the  
specification, and the conflict register of `3tk-drafts-review-001.md`. The  
drafts themselves were not reopened. `src/` was not reopened.

Toolchain measured: `c3c` 0.8.3, git `1d155ee`, LLVM 22.1.8, linux-x64.

Method. Twelve probes, compiled and run, three of them negative — written to  
fail, with the compiler message as the evidence. Every answer is marked  
*verified* (compiled) or *read* (stdlib source only). Probe sources are  
reproduced inside the document rather than kept as files, so it is  
self-contained.

Result: eleven of the twelve questions are a clean yes.

- Q1 generic modules. A full per-type helper, Part 7.2's seven members, was
  generated for two outer types and exercised, including the moving crossing on  
  a mismatch.
- Q2 `typeid` satisfies every clause of Part 5.1. Two identically-shaped
  structs carry different values. This closes C1.
- Q3 both embeddings work. `inline` gives an implicit conversion; `::members`
  gives the offset, so the inner may sit anywhere. Part 4.3's offset-zero  
  fallback is not needed.
- Q4 is the one real no. **C3 0.8.3 has no private struct fields**, and a
  public alias to a `@private` struct re-exports the layout. A  
  `typedef Pool = void` does hide, at the cost that the container is no longer  
  literally the struct embedding the inner. Two drafts build on private fields.
- Q5 interfaces with `@dynamic`. An interface value is nullable and carries the
  concrete typeid. The specification's own hook signatures compile; the three  
  in `3tk-additions.md` were a misreading, not a C3 limit.
- Q7 threads, mutex, and **three** condition waits, one of them `wait_until` on
  an absolute deadline. Part 16 row 7 — ztk's 71 hand-written lines — is  
  deleted. The relative `wait_timeout` recomputes the deadline on every call,  
  so a loop built on it silently violates Part 2.5.
- Q11 has a trap. A plain `assert` is active in a safe build, a no-op at
  `--safe=no -O0`, and an optimizer assumption at `--safe=no -O3` — where a  
  violated one is undefined behaviour, not a missed check. `always_assert`  
  aborts in every mode, which is what Part 11.12 needs.
- Q12 `$Type::members` with `.name`, `.type`, `.offset`. Part 7.4's validation
  runs at build time and names the offending type, verified.

Also found, in no draft: `any` is reserved as a module name but `Any` is a  
usable type name, which closes C3; a struct name that is all uppercase is  
rejected; and `std::collections::anylist` already exists and shallow-copies  
every element, which is the semantic opposite of the Matryoshka list under the  
name the drafts chose for it.

Rulings delivered on the register: C1 and C3 closed, C5 closed on the  
mechanism, C2 and C10 priced but left open, C7 narrowed, C4 C6 C8 C9 C11  
untouched as not C3 questions. One question reopened that the drafts had  
settled: Q4.

*Advice on clear: yes. 3TK-5 reads this document, not this reasoning.*

---

## 2026-08-23 — 3TK-3, the drafts review

Written: `3tk-drafts-review-001.md`. 462 lines.

Inputs: the seven `c3/` drafts, `matryoshka-specification-001.md`,  
`ztk-audit-001.md`. Nothing else was opened. `src/` was not reopened.

Shape of the file:

- One table per draft. One row per claim, with a verdict, the conflicting
  draft where there is one, and a recommendation.
- Six verdicts: HOLDS, GAP, CONFLICT-S against the specification, CONFLICT-D
  against another draft, UNVERIFIED for a C3 language claim, OUT for anything  
  outside the specification's subject.
- Section 8 lists what no draft covers: 22 parts, and 12 of the 33 invariants
  of Part 18.
- Section 9 is the conflict register, C1 to C11. Each names both sides and
  what the specification says.
- Section 10 is what to carry into 3TK-4 and 3TK-5.

What the review found.

- 117 claims measured across the seven files.
- `3tk-poc.md` is the outlier. Its node has no type identity field, so Parts 5,
  6 and 7 have nothing to stand on, and its pool has one free list instead of  
  one per identity. It also ships a `Master`, which Part 1.3 forbids by name.  
  Its wait loop restarts the timeout on every spurious wakeup, against Part  
  2.5. It predates the other six by three days.
- `3tk-porting-notes.md` is the best of the seven. Its verification rule — what
  is confirmed architecture versus what needs a compilable prototype — is Part  
  21 arrived at independently.
- Four drafts assume C3 `typeid` satisfies Part 5.1 and none of them checks it.
  `ztk-to-3tk.md` flagged it as the dangerous area and was ignored. That is  
  conflict C1 and it is 3TK-4's first question.
- All four drafts that name the Slot attach the word to the pointer-to-Slot
  rather than to the Slot. The representation they propose is right. Conflict  
  C4, and `3tk-porting-notes.md` has it in its *confirmed* column.
- The hooks interface of `3tk-additions.md` picks the mechanism the
  specification leans to, then gets all three signatures wrong against Part  
  12.2, and drops `tags`, which Part 11.7 needs.
- `3tk-build-dist.md` and `3tk-poc.md` both describe a fourth layer — Master,
  Select, Group, Future — that Part 1.2, Part 1.3 and Part 16 all deny.

Nothing was resolved. Eleven conflicts are registered and the owner rules.

Recommended retirement: `3tk-poc.md` and `ztk-to-3tk.md`, kept on disk.

*Advice on clear: no. The ruling on C1 to C11 needs this reasoning in context.*

---

## 2026-08-23 — 3TK-2, the portable specification

Written: `matryoshka-specification-001.md`. 22 numbered parts, plus Part 0 for  
the conformance markings and Part 21 for the questionnaire.

Inputs: `ztk-audit-001.md` and this plan. `src/` was not reopened, as the plan  
required.

Shape of the file:

- Part 0 defines MUST, SHOULD, MAY, EXCLUDED. Every element in Parts 1 to 20
  carries one.
- Parts 1 to 15 are the owner's spine, one section each, in the owner's order.
- Part 16 is the excluded surface, twelve rows, from `audit 4`.
- Part 18 restates every MUST as a 33-row table, in the order a port meets
  them.
- Part 19 is the outcome set, as values, with no error sets.
- Part 20 is the ten decisions each port makes for itself.
- Part 21 is the questionnaire, twelve questions, each with a "if no" line
  naming what the port pays instead.
- Part 22 is a suggested porting order. Not conformance.

Decisions taken while writing, and why:

- **The heading "execution model" was not used.** Both words are on the banned
  list of `rules-049.md` Part 5. The plan names that section. Part 2 is called  
  "Threads and waiting" and says so in its first line.
- **The word "idiomatic" was not used** either, for the same reason. The plan
  uses it. The specification says "the port's business" instead.
- **The questionnaire grew from ten questions to twelve.** The plan listed
  eight subjects. The audit's draft list had ten. Two more earned a place:  
  build modes, because Part 8.6 and Part 15.5 both depend on whether an assert  
  can be compiled out; and compile-time reflection on fields, which is separate  
  from compile-time generation and a language can have one without the other.
- **The excluded surface was compressed from 16 rows to 12.** Four of the
  audit's rows are the same declaration counted on both containers. The  
  specification is language-neutral, so it names the declaration once.
- **Two spellings were added to Part 16 that the audit did not call excluded**
  — error sets as the return channel, and the marker constant that selects the  
  reduced helper. Both are `audit 3` rows marked incidental. Neither is a  
  semantic, and a port that copies them has copied Zig.
- **The waiting-get contradiction was resolved toward the code.** Part 11.9
  says the waiting get never creates, and records that the book disagrees. The  
  audit's ruling, carried forward.
- **The allocator was written as SHOULD, not MUST.** Part 13.1 states the
  intended shape. Part 13.3 records that ztk is not there. Part 13.4 leaves the  
  application-item half open for 3TK-5, as the audit asked.

What the writing produced that the plan did not predict:

- The link-test blind spot (`audit 2.2`) is not a Zig detail. It is a design
  line that every port meets, and it costs a field per item to close. It became  
  Part 8.7, a MUST, and a decision in Part 20.
- The memory-ordering half of a transfer (`audit 2.8`) is invisible in every
  signature and is the reason the toolkit needs no locks around application  
  data. It became Part 14.2, and it is the invariant most likely to be lost in  
  a port that reads only the signatures.
- Part 17 is not in the plan's list. The three tools with two optional is in
  the plan's second paragraph of the stage, and it turned out to be the test of  
  the layering *and* the porting order. It earned its own part.

Length: 1366 lines against the plan's expected 600-900. The staccato rule of  
`rules-049.md` Part 6 is one fact per line, and 33 invariants plus 12 questions  
plus 22 parts do not compress below this without dropping facts. Flagged for  
the owner. Nothing was padded; nothing was cut to fit.

Verification:

- Banned-word scan of the new file: four hits, two fixed ("holds" in the
  custody sense, "underneath"), two kept. `unlock` is the mutex operation.  
  `holds` in "this holds for" is the truth sense, not custody.
- `kitchen/tools/check_design.sh` exits 1, not the 0 the plan expected. It
  exited 1 before this stage too. 43 problems: 14 dead links in `design/`, and  
  29 orphans, every one of them under `design/secondary/lang/`. This stage  
  added exactly one row — the new specification file — and it is the drift  
  already recorded as `audit 7.1`: `design/secondary/context.md` does not list  
  the `lang/` subfolders at all. Not fixed. Owner's call.

---

## 2026-08-23 — 3TK-1, the ztk audit

Read-only stage. Five `src/` files and eight documents, nothing else. The  
firewall against the seven `c3/` drafts was kept.

Written: `ztk-audit-001.md`. Seven sections, as the plan named them.

What the reading produced that the plan did not predict:

- The excluded surface is 16 declarations, not a vague "the Io parts". Twelve
  of them vanish outright in a language whose condition variable has a timed  
  wait. `src/internal/cond_timeout.zig` is 71 lines that exist for one missing  
  standard-library call.
- The allocator gap is wider than "ztk is not exactly there". Both containers
  already keep an allocator at creation — and both `destroy` functions take  
  another one as a parameter and use *that*, never the kept one. Nothing checks  
  the two match. Application items keep none at all, and `PolyNode` has no field  
  for one.
- Five more intended-versus-actual gaps beside the allocator. The largest:
  `Pool.get_wait` does not call `on_get`, and the book says twice that it does.  
  The code is the truth.
- Four pieces of documentation drift, none of which touches `src/`. The
  architecture note still shows the pre-API-12 handle shape, and the Zig-0.16  
  notes still say `_Mailbox` / `_Pool`.

Three invariants the plan did not list, found in the code and worth a section  
each in the specification:

- The deadline is anchored once, before the retry loop. Converting a duration
  inside the loop restarts the timeout on every spurious wakeup. Both waiting  
  functions say so in the same words.
- A waiter that leaves on timeout or cancel re-signals if the container is not
  empty. Without it a pending signal dies with the leaver.
- The transfer orders memory. The new holder sees every write the previous one
  made, because the container publishes through its own mutex. That is why the  
  toolkit can assert on an item's internal state at all, and it appears in no  
  signature.

Judgement calls recorded in the audit rather than made silently:

- `Mbox.wakeUpAll` is *not* an Io bridge and stays in scope. It has its own
  epoch mechanism.
- Table dispatch's "no switch over tags" is a Zig obstacle, not a Matryoshka
  invariant. The invariant it protects — one handler per (receiver, tag) pair,  
  the Slot carries the result — is portable.
- Whether `send_oob` survives a port is left open. It is one priority level,
  and it exists because the two-channel model folds signals into the data  
  channel as tagged items at the front.

44 features classified essential / should / may / incidental / excluded, one row  
each with its reason. The recurring verdict is "shape essential, spelling free":  
the tag, the compile-time helper, the hooks interface and scope-exit cleanup are  
all required in shape and free in spelling.

Advice: clear. The specification works from `ztk-audit-001.md`, not from the  
reading. Nothing in this session's context is needed by 3TK-2 that the audit  
does not carry.

## 2026-08-23 — 3TK-0, the staging plan

The port family got its names: otk (Odin), ztk (Zig), 3tk (C3), dtk (D). 3tk is  
the active target. otk is refactored later, ztk tuned later, dtk is thinking  
only.

The owner set the storage rule first: every file for this work — plans, status,  
log, outputs — lives in `design/secondary/lang/c3/`. The main `design/STATUS.md`  
and `STATUS-LOG.md` stay untouched. Plans do not live in Claude memory.

The seven drafts already in this folder were written at different times by  
different AIs and contradict each other. That is what made a specification  
necessary rather than a porting note: without a yardstick, the contradictions  
propagate into whatever gets written next.

The owner gave the spine of the specification directly:

- plain threads, not fibers, not goroutines
- participants are long-lived heap objects
- intrusion — an embedded inner structure carrying the list links
- identity of the outer, carried in the inner
- self-identification by comparing against that identity
- a compile-time-generated per-type helper: initializer plus the conversions
  across the type-erased border
- an intrusive list for heterogeneous items
- the Slot idiom, a container of pointers
- deliberate synonyms — handle, slot, item — kept, not collapsed
- Mbox and Pool on one internal base, implementations hidden where the language
  allows, hooks as an interface
- allocators taken at creation and held for life — the direction, not yet
  exactly what ztk does

Two rulings on vocabulary. **inner** and **outer**, never "parent", because  
"parent" names a different relation in each language. And porting is not  
transpiling: idiomatic code per language, the tag being the example — hand-rolled  
in ztk, native in C3.

Two exclusions. Everything built for the `std.Io` bridge is out of scope for  
ports, and the specification must be self-contained, with only the three `src/`  
files as external reference — so it can serve dtk as well as 3tk.

Advice given and accepted on the shape of the specification: conformance  
markings (MUST / SHOULD / MAY / EXCLUDED) on every element, and a closing  
capability questionnaire that each language answers in turn. That questionnaire  
is what makes the later proposal stages mechanical without making them  
transliterations.

Two changes the owner made to the proposed staging: the review stage was named  
"ledger", which was rejected as unclear, and is now **3TK-3 drafts review**; and  
the C3 install step was dropped, because C3 is already installed —  
`/usr/bin/c3c`, stdlib at `/home/g41797/dev/langs/c3/lib/std/`.

The owner added the cold-start rule: every stage must be runnable after a  
context clear, and every stage must end by advising whether to clear.

Written: `3tk-staging-plan-001.md`, `3tk-status.md`, `3tk-log.md`.

Follow-up the same day, at the owner's instruction: the cold-start rule was  
incomplete without a way to *invoke* a stage. Each stage now prints the exact  
line the owner types to start it after a clear, and the status file repeats the  
next one. A stage closes by naming the command for the next. Without that, cold  
start meant "the agent could run it", not "the owner can start it".

## 2026-08-23 — versioning ruled

The three files created for 3TK-0 were inconsistent: all carried a `-001`  
suffix, and all three were then edited in place, which Part 0 forbids.

Owner's ruling: the same three-way split `design/` already uses.

- `3tk-status.md` and `3tk-log.md` lose the suffix and are edited in place. They
  are entry points, not documents — the analogues of `STATUS.md` and  
  `STATUS-LOG.md`.
- The plan keeps its suffix. A change makes `3tk-staging-plan-002.md`, and the
  superseded version stays on disk, listed in the status file.
- Every stage output is versioned the same way.

That created one problem and fixed it in the same move. The start command named  
the plan by version, and a versioned filename moves, so every bump would have  
broken the line the owner types. The command now names `3tk-status.md`, which  
never moves and which says which plan version is current.

Renamed: `3tk-status-001.md` to `3tk-status.md`, `3tk-log-001.md` to  
`3tk-log.md`. Both were created the same day and untracked, so no `git mv` was  
involved. Every cross-reference repointed.

Owner's ruling on the same day: the plan stays `3tk-staging-plan-001.md`. The  
edits made during 3TK-0 — the start commands, the versioning section — are part  
of its initial version, not revisions of a published one. Nothing referenced it  
yet. Versioning is strict from here: the next change makes `-002`.
