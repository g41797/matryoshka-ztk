# The four builds. Name, then the flags.
# NOTE, and it is a finding of 3TK-6 rather than a detail:

#   `-O2` and above turn safe mode OFF implicitly. `c3c ... -O3` reports
#   SAFE_MODE=false. So the proposal's "safe, optimized" build cannot be
#   spelled `-O3`; it must be `--safe=yes -O3`, or it silently becomes the
#   fast build and tests nothing the fast build does not already test.

# 3TK-65 added the last two. Part 5.2 asserts the identity at BOTH boundaries and
# the two programs are not variants of one another: `unstamped_insert` reaches
# `@guard_insert` and never reaches a crossing, `unstamped_crossing` fills the
# Slot by hand and so never reaches a guard. A suite with one of them would go
# green with the other boundary unguarded.
#
# 3TK-75 added the two after them, and they are the third boundary rather than a
# third variant. `C-1` stopped `OuterHelper.inner` writing the identity and made
# it verify one, so the crossing OUT is now guarded too: `unstamped_inner` gives
# it an outer that was never stamped, `wrong_type_inner` one stamped as another
# type. The second is the half no stamp could ever have caught — the old
# `inner()` would have re-stamped it and agreed with itself afterwards.
#
# 3TK-88 added the five `any_` programs, the border with C3's `any`:
#
#   any_wrong_type_must  a plain wrong type, through the must_ form
#   any_forged           `.type` and `otrtypeid` disagree; the plain form aborts too
#   any_unstamped        an unstamped outer arrives
#   any_linked           an outer crosses while it is on a queue
#   any_full_target      `to_any` into an `any` that is not empty

# A TIER 1 negative aborts in EVERY mode, including --safe=no -O3. Part 11.12 is
# the one precondition the specification refuses to soften, and this is the only
# shape in the suite whose expected behaviour does not change with the build.
#
# 3TK-53 added `release_while_receiving`. Part 11.12 has two halves, and the
# suite tested one of them: an OPEN mailbox cannot be released, and neither can
# a CLOSED one that is not yet quiet. The second half is the one a real program
# gets wrong, because closing looks like it finished something.
#
# 3TK-54 added the pool's four. The mailbox needs one program for the second
# half and the pool needs four, because Part 12.3 forces the mutex open across
# every call into a hook: a pool can be closed and not quiet in four distinct
# places, and each one is a different site rather than a different schedule of
# the same site.
#
#   release_not_quiet_pool      a get_wait woken by the close, not yet returned
#   release_during_on_put       a put inside on_put, about to re-take the mutex
#   release_during_on_close     close's own hook, after CLOSED is published

# A compile-time negative never compiles, in any mode, and its message must name the type.
#
# 3TK-64 RETIRED TWO OF THESE, and the retirement is the stage, not a loss of
# coverage. `nocompile_managed_no_allocator` and `nocompile_managed_two_allocators`
# asserted that an outer without exactly one `Allocator` field does not compile.
# There is no allocator-field concept any more — the allocator is passed to
# `create` and `release` — so both of those outers must now compile AND RUN.
# The proof moved to `test/t_helper.c3`, where it is a positive test:
# `an_outer_needs_no_allocator_field` and `two_allocator_fields_are_the_outers_business`.
#
# 3TK-74 ADDED TWO, and they are the other direction of the same idea: the first
# two assert that a type WITHOUT an `Inner` is refused, these two that a type
# with one but without its hooks is refused. `B-1` made `init` and `finish`
# required, and the whole point of the change is that a misspelled hook stopped
# being silent — so `nocompile_no_init` spells it `initialize`, the near miss
# `helper.c3`'s module block names, rather than omitting it.
#
# What is grepped for here is the `$assert` message and not a type name. The
# message is a constant string, so it cannot carry the offending type; the
# compiler names the CALL SITE instead, which is the half a user needs. The
# other direction of the check — that it stays quiet for a type that declares
# both hooks — is the test suite, green in all four builds.

#
# "Both are built ON the intrusive layer, with no privileged access to it.
#  Every crossing they perform is a crossing an application could write."
#
# Part 17.3 calls this the test of the design, so it is a test.
#
# The strongest available form, and C3 gives it for free: `mailbox.c3` and
# `pool.c3` declare `module mtk::mailbox` and `module mtk::pool`, and a
# submodule CANNOT see its parent's `@private` declarations. So the layering is
# enforced by the compiler, not by this grep. The grep guards the declaration
# itself, which is the thing a careless edit would undo.
#
# 3TK-pre-65 REWROTE IT FOR SIX NAMES. Part 4.5: the module line IS the design,
# so the check asserts the whole list rather than two of it — every file
# declares exactly what the design says it declares, and no file declares
# anything else. `helper.c3` and `queue.c3` went back to modules of their own,
# and a check that knew only `mailbox` and `pool` would have gone red on the
# correct change.
#
# 3TK-70 REWROTE IT AGAIN, FOR ELEVEN NAMES IN SIX FILES, and the shape had to
# change with the count: a file is no longer one module. Each of `inner.c3`,
# `queue.c3` and `mailbox.c3` carries two sections and `pool.c3` carries three,
# so what is asserted per file is the ORDERED LIST of its module lines. Order
# is part of it: `pool.c3` opens on `mtk::pool::hooks` the way `atomic.c3` opens
# on `std::atomic::types`, and a section that drifted to the wrong place would
# take its imports with it.
#
# This is the trap `3TK-pre-65` and `3TK-67` both hit, and it is deliberate: a
# correct module change goes RED here first, and the list moves in the same pass.

# 3TK-70 MOVED THE TRUTH FROM POSITION TO MODULE. 3TK-67 keyed this check on
# where a declaration sits relative to `// For internal usage - everything below
# this line.`, and that was the strongest form available while a file was one
# module. It is not any more: each of `inner.c3`, `queue.c3`, `mailbox.c3` and
# `pool.c3` now carries an `mtk::X::internal` section, because `c3c docgen`
# groups by module and by nothing else and a page wants one subject.
#
# The module is strictly stronger than the position. A banner is a comment: it
# can be renamed, duplicated or deleted, and the check has to assert its
# presence first to stop itself quietly grepping nothing. A module section is
# the compiler's own partition — a declaration cannot fail to be in one, and
# nothing between the module line and the next one can be outside it.
#
# THE BANNER STAYS, and it stays as a section header for a human reading the
# file. It is asserted below, by name, exactly as before. What changed is that
# it no longer decides anything.
#
# The check still runs BOTH WAYS: every declaration in an `::internal` section
# opens its block with the marker, and no declaration outside one does. The

# to grepping the whole file or nothing at all. Part 4.5 of the boundaries
# document records that this grep is the only enforcement there is, because

# --- Part 5.2: the identity is checked at BOTH boundaries ---
#
# 3TK-65. Eight call sites, and a count rather than a list of files, because
# the failure this guards against is a site being DELETED, not a site being
# wrong. The four crossings of `helper.c3` are the late boundary and the two
# `@guard_insert` bodies are the early one; a suite that only ran the negatives
# would still go green with sites missing, since two programs cannot reach
# eight of them.
#
# THE CROSSINGS ARE FOUR AND THEIR CALL SITES ARE SIX. Plan 029 says four, and
# it is counting crossings; `look` and `must_look` each dispatch on `$Typeof`
# into a `Slot*` arm and an `Inner*` arm, and each arm is a site of its own
# that can be dropped on its own. The measurement wins over the charter's
# figure and this is where it is written down (`3tk-rules-001.md` Rule 10).
#
# 3TK-88 MADE THEM TEN. `is` adds a `Slot*` and an `Inner*` branch, and `to_any`
# and `must_to_any` read a Slot. The `any*` branches are counted separately below.
#
# The count is the check and the negatives are the proof: `unstamped_insert`
# proves the guard aborts, `unstamped_crossing` proves the crossing does, and
# this proves the other four were not quietly dropped by a later stage.
#
# `check_stamped` is grepped and not `@check`, because the whole point of the
# shared macro is that all six carry the same null tolerance. A site that
# open-coded the condition would be a site that could get the tolerance wrong,
# and it must go red here.
