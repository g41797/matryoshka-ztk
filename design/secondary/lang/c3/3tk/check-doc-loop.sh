# 3TK-39. The doc loop's checker. Facts only, no opinions.
#
# The invariant:
#
#     Every descriptor line in `3tk/src` appears in
#     `design/secondary/lang/c3/ref/3tk-reference-004.md`.
#
# One direction only. The reference is allowed to say more — Usual flow, the
# diagrams, the whole of Part 6. The source is a subset of it, never the
# reverse. The property that matters is that no comment says anything the
# reference does not.
#
# The procedure this script serves is
# `design/secondary/lang/c3/ref/3tk-doc-loop-003.md`. Read it before acting on
# anything printed here. This script reports. It rules on nothing, and it
# rewrites nothing.
#
# Usage:  ./check-doc-loop.sh [file.c3 ...]
#
# With no argument, every file in `src/`. A bare name is looked up in `src/`.
# Exit 0 when nothing is missing and the ban scan is empty, 1 otherwise,
# 2 on a usage or environment failure.

# --- the module-block check ---
#
# The second kind of check, and the one 3TK-47 added. A module description is
# not judged and not matched sentence by sentence: it is a copy of the
# reference's labelled block, and the check is a `diff`. The transformation is
# one leading space per line and nothing else. `doc_blocks.py` holds it, and
# `ref/3tk-doc-loop-003.md` rules on it under *Moving a module description*.
#
# The two checks report separately and the exit status covers both.
#
# 3TK-63 added the third case. A module may be written in several sections and
# several files — `module mtk;` was `mtk.c3`, `inner.c3` and `queue.c3` — and a
# module has ONE description however many sections it is written in. So a
# section that carries no `<* *>` above its module line is not a miss: it is a
# section, and it says so in a `//` banner. What IS checked is that every
# labelled block in the reference is carried by EXACTLY ONE file, so that a
# description cannot go missing by every section deciding it belongs elsewhere.
#
# 3TK-70 TURNED THAT AROUND: it is now the ordinary case for one FILE to carry
# several modules, rather than one module to be spread over several files. Each
# of `inner.c3`, `queue.c3` and `mailbox.c3` carries two sections and `pool.c3`
# carries three, so the loop below walks SECTIONS and a file is checked as many
# times as it has module lines. `mtk::helper` joins them: the widened module
# pattern in `doc_blocks.py` sees a generic module line, so the helper's
# description is a labelled block that is diffed like every other, where it used
# to be prose the loop could not check at all. Eleven modules, eleven blocks.
